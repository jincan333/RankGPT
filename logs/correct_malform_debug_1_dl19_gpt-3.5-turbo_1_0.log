 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention the duration or length of the flea life cycle. Based on that, we can create an initial ranking. Here are the passages that mention the duration of the flea life cycle:

[3] 1 Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages. made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. 1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.

[6] Stickfast flea life history. The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil.

[9] How Long Do Fleas Live. Flea Life Span. Fleas can live up to a year and a half when they have a food supply, the optimum temperature (70F to 85F), and ideal humidity (70%). In reality though, most live for an average of 2-3 months. Even if you remove the pets from your house for a time, the fleas can still survive for several months without feeding.

[11] Life Cycle (Back to Top). The cat flea life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis, involving the stages of an egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This cycle usually lasts 30 to 75 days, yet may vary due to external factors, such as temperature and humidity.

[15] Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating. They prefer blood from your pet, but in the absence of a canine or feline host, fleas will bite people.

[19] The Flea Life Cycle. Fleas undergo complete metamorphosis with four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Environmental variables influence the length of each developmental stage. Fleas prefer a warm, humid environment, with temperatures ranging between 70° and 90° Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 75% or more.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order based on their relevance to the query.

[7] How Long Do Fleas Live. Flea Life Span. Fleas can live up to a year and a half when they have a food supply, the optimum temperature (70F to 85F), and ideal humidity (70%). In reality though, most live for an average of 2-3 months.

[8] The whole cycle can be as quick as 20 days or can last up to one full year; this is because the flea may be in a dormant stage for a long time. The cycle can be interrupted at any stage, but some flea control methods are more effective than others depending upon the stage the flea is in.

[12] Life Cycle (Back to Top). The cat flea life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis, involving the stages of an egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This cycle usually lasts 30 to 75 days, yet may vary due to external factors, such as temperature and humidity.

[15] The flea life cycle has four stages: 1 Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. 2 Larva: When the eggs hats, larvae emerge. 3 Pupa: Once in the cocoon, the larva begins its transformation into the adult flea. Adult flea: A fully-developed flea only emerges from its cocoon when a host is available.

[18] Stickfast flea life history. The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs.

The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil. After several moults, they grow to about 3 mm, cease to feed and burrow down into the soil to a depth of about 15 cm.

[11] Fleas have four main stages in their life cycle: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The total flea life cycle can range from a couple weeks to several months, depending on environmental conditions.
[12] The flea life cycle has four stages: 1 Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. 2 Larva: When the eggs hatch, larvae emerge. 3 Pupa: Once in the cocoon, the larva begins its transformation into the adult flea. Adult flea: A fully-developed flea only emerges from its cocoon when a host is available.
[13] There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels, the total life cycle will take anywhere from a couple weeks to many months.
[14] The cat flea life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis, involving the stages of an egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This cycle usually lasts 30 to 75 days, yet may vary due to external factors, such as temperature and humidity.
[15] Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages, made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae, and only 5% biting adults. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally, the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.
[16] A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months.
[17] Fleas can live up to a year and a half when they have a food supply, the optimum temperature (70F to 85F), and ideal humidity (70%). In reality though, most live for an average of 2-3 months.
[19] Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, as long as they do not emerge from their cocoons. Newly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the search query "definition declaratory judgment." Based on the content of the passages, the following passages are likely to be the most relevant:

[3] Declaratory ActThe repeal of the Stamp Act did not mean that Great Britain was surrendering any control over its colonies. The Declaratory Act, passed by Parliament on the same day the Stamp Act was repealed, stated that Parliament could make laws binding the American colonies in all cases whatsoever.

[10] The Declaratory Act was a measure issued by British Parliament asserting its authority to make laws binding the colonists "in all cases whatsoever" including the right to tax. The Declaratory Act was a reaction of British Parliament to the failure of the Stamp Act as they did not want to give up on the principle of imperial taxation asserting its legal right to tax colonies.

[20] Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in March 1766 - and declared the Declaratory Act-parliament's full right to make laws to bind the colonies and people of America...in all cases whatsoever..- and Parliament renewed the Quartering Act.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance:

[6] Nolo's Plain-English Law Dictionary. A court decision in a civil case that tells the parties what their rights and responsibilities are, without awarding damages or ordering them to do anything. Courts are usually reluctant to hear declaratory judgment cases, preferring to wait until there has been a measurable loss. But especially in cases involving important constitutional rights, courts will step in to clarify the legal landscape.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention the temperature at which hydrogen becomes a liquid. Based on that, we can rank the passages accordingly. Here are the relevant passages:

[6] Hydrogen Bonding Water is a liquid at room temperature due to the presence of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. The state of a molecule is determined by intermoâ¦lecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions, Van der Waals forces (also called London dispersion forces), and hydrogen bonds.

[11] Liquid metallic hydrogen: Helium is a liquid at normal pressure and temperatures near absolute zero, a result of its high zero-point energy (ZPE), the lowest possible energy.

[12] Methane's boiling point is about 110K, compared to hydrogen's 20K. This means that both fuel and oxidizer lines can be purged with gaseous nitrogen. Liquid hydrogen lines can only be purged with helium, as hydrogen's boiling point is below the melting point of other inert gases.

Now, let's rank these passages:

[Start] [12] > [6] > [11] [End]

Please note that this ranking is based on the direct mention of the temperature at which hydrogen becomes a liquid.

[2] Trans fat (also called trans fatty acid) is created when unsaturated fats are hydrogenated (combined with hydrogen), a chemical process that causes fats that would normally be liquid at room temperature to become solid. American Heart Association-Stroke Association answered. Trans fats, also called trans fatty acids, are a type of fat formed when liquid vegetable oils go through a chemical process in which hydrogen is added to make the oils more solid.

[9] Interesting Facts about Hydrogen. 1 Scientists estimate that Hydrogen makes up over 90 percent of all the atoms in the universe. 2 It is the only element that can exist without neutrons. 3 Hydrogen becomes a liquid at very low temperature and high pressure. 4 Around 10 percent of the mass of the human body is hydrogen.

[18] 1 Liquid metallic hydrogen: Helium is a liquid at normal pressure and temperatures near absolute zero, a result of its high zero-point energy (ZPE), the lowest possible energy.

Now, let's rank these passages:

[Start] [9] > [18] > [2] [End]

Please note that this is an initial ranking based on the direct mention of hydrogen becoming a liquid at low temperature. We will continue refining the ranking in the next steps.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention the temperature at which hydrogen becomes a liquid. Based on that, we can rank them accordingly. Here are the relevant passages:

[11] Hydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (−252.87°C, −423.17 °F). Hydrogen is often stored in this way as liquid hydrogen takes up less space than hydrogen in its normal gas form. Liquid hydrogen is also used as a rocket fuel.

[15] For Hydrogen, the boiling point is -253 degrees Celsius; for Mercury it is 357 degrees Celsius, and for Iron it is 2,750 degrees Celsius. From these numbers you can see that at room temperature (and indeed for nearly any temperature found on Earth) Hydrogen is a gas, Mercury is a liquid, and Iron is a solid.

Now, let's rank them:

[3] Liquid hydrogen or slush hydrogen may be used, as in the Space Shuttle. However, liquid hydrogen requires cryogenic storage and boils around 20.268 K (−252.882 °C or −423.188 °F). Hence, its liquefaction imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature).

[10] For hydrogen to be in a fully liquid state without boiling at atmospheric pressure, it needs to be cooled to 20.28 K (−423.17 °F/−252.87 °C).

Now, let's rank these passages:

[7] Hydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (â252.87Â°C, â423.17 Â°F). Hydrogen is often stored in this way as liquid hydrogen takes up less space than hydrogen in its normal gas form. Liquid hydrogen is also used as a rocket fuel.

[11] Hydrogen is found naturally in the molecular H2 form. To exist as a liquid, H2 must be cooled below hydrogen's critical point of 33 K. However, for hydrogen to be in a fully liquid state without boiling at atmospheric pressure, it needs to be cooled to 20.28 K (â423.17 Â°F/â252.87 Â°C).

[13] Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Hydrogen, like water, can exist in 3 states....Solid, Liquid and Gas Its temperature as a solid is â259.14 Â°C' Hydrogen melts to liquid at â252.87 Â°C. It boils and vaporizes at -252.125 Â°C Just cooling or compressing Hydrogen won't liquefy or freeze it.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly address the social determinants of health. Based on the provided passages, the following passages specifically mention the social determinants of health:

[2] Closing the gap in a generation: Health equity through action on the social determinants of health (PDF) - Final report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. Geneva, 2008, World Health Organization.
[5] Social determinants of health reflect the social factors and physical conditions of the environment in which people are born, live, learn, play, work, and age. Also known as social and physical determinants of health, they impact a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes.
[7] The determinants of health include: the social and economic environment, the physical environment, and; the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.
[8] Social and physical determinants of health impact a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes.
[11] Social Determinants of Health. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines the social determinants of health as the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels.
[12] Understanding Social Determinants of Health. Social determinants of health are conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.
[14] The social determinants of health (SDOH) are defined by the idea that health is determined by the social, economic, and physical environments in which people live and work, as well as by individuals' particular.
[15] The social determinants of health are linked to the economic and social conditions and their distribution among the population that influence individual and group differences in health status.
[16] Social Determinants of Health. The complex, integrated, and overlapping social structures and economic systems that are responsible for most health inequities. These social structures and economic systems include the social environment, physical environment, health services, and structural and societal factors.
[17] We refer to these factors collectively as the "social determinants of health." This report (first in a series) focuses particularly on the "social environment," defined as the combination of social and cultural institutions, norms, patterns, beliefs, and processes that influence the life of an individual or community.
[18] The social determinants of health (SDOH) are linked to the economic and social conditions and their distribution among the population that influence individual and group differences in health status.
[19] These social structures and economic systems include the social environment, physical environment, health services, and structural and societal factors. Social determinants of health are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources throughout local communities, nations, and the world [9].

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance to the search query.

repetition, missing or mismatch: 
 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention "right pelvic pain causes" or provide relevant information about it. Based on the query, the following passages seem to be the most relevant:

[6] [Start] what can cause a dull menstrual like cramp pain on right side of pelvic area? For the past 3 to 4 days I have been having a menstrual cramp like pain but it is only on the right side. It is not a severe pain but enough of pain that after 4 days it has worn me down and made it hard to do anything. I have taken perscription Ibprofen I had left from my gallbladder surgery and it doesnt seem to help. [End]

[19] [Start] The severity of the condition mainly depends on the cause of the pain whether it is female left groin pain or female right groin pain. Mild groin pain usually heals with time. Groin pain experienced by women may be caused due to underlying conditions and some of these conditions are more serious than the other. Certain medical conditions like inguinal hernia and kidney stones may be the reason for groin pain in women. Other causes of groin pain include sports activities, vehicle accidents, etc. Causes of Female Groin Pain: Some general causes of groin pain in women include: Pregnancy: Certain hormonal changes take place in pregnancy which raises looseness of the pelvic joints.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that specifically mention "right pelvic pain causes." Based on a quick scan, the following passages seem to be relevant to the query:

[4] Chronic pelvic pain has many possible causes, and the symptoms may vary with what's causing the pain. Endometriosis is a condition in which the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus. The lining can attach to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, intestines or other structures in the pelvis. Adenomyosis occurs when tissue from the lining of the uterus grows in the muscle of the uterus. Endometriosis may cause pelvic pain, especially during menstruation. Hormones of the menstrual cycle cause the endometriosis to bleed each month. This can be painful and result in the formation of pelvic adhesions, also known as scar tissue. Blood trapped in the ovary can build up into a cyst.

[12] Scarring in the fallopian tubes and other pelvic structures can also cause chronic pelvic pain (pain that lasts for months or even years). Women with repeated episodes of PID are more likely to suffer infertility, ectopic pregnancy, or chronic pelvic pain.

Now, let's rank these two passages.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention "right pelvic pain causes" or provide relevant information about it. Here are the passages that are most relevant to the query:

[1] Some uterine fibroids cause pelvic pain (mild, moderate, or severe), pain during intercourse, pelvic pressure pain, and may interfere with a womanâs ability conceive. Uterine fibroids are most common in women in their 30s and 40s. Women that have symptoms should consult their OB/GYN doctor.
[4] Organs in your pelvis include your bowel, bladder, womb (uterus) and ovaries. Pelvic pain usually means pain that starts from one of these organs. In some cases the pain comes from your pelvic bones that lie next to these organs, or from nearby muscles, nerves, blood vessels or joints. So, there are many causes of pelvic pain. Pelvic pain is more common in women than in men.
[9] But all back pain, whether it is your right lower back pain now, or any back pain issue, comes from 4 main factors - tight muscles, weak muscles, joint movement and pelvic balance. With right lower back pain both the link between the Sacrum and the Pelvis is the most likely cause. The imbalances in the pelvis create tension on the Sacro-Iliac joint and hence pain occurs. To ease this pain and build strength ion the area you need to use techniques that work well and quickly.
[17] Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection in the ovaries, uterus, or fallopian tubes. It is most often caused by sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea or chlamydia. It is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain in women.
[20] A common example of chronic pelvic pain is dysmenorrhea or menstrual cramps. Other causes of chronic pelvic pain include endometriosis, adenomyosis, and ovulation pain. Sometimes an illness starts with intermittent pelvic pain that becomes constant over time, this is often a signal that the problem has become worse.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance to the query:

[Start] [1] > [4] > [9] > [17] > [20] [End]

Please note that this is an initial ranking based on the relevance of the passages to the query.

[5] - This condition can cause excruciating lower right abdominal pain when the stones are in the kidney or urethra.
[8] - They are commonly caused by the new condition. During implantation women often experience pelvic cramps or pulling pains. If future embryo attaches to the right side of the uterine, a woman can feel mild pain in the right part of her lower abdomen. Left-side attachment means abdominal discomfort on the left.
[17] - Scarring in the fallopian tubes and other pelvic structures can also cause chronic pelvic pain (pain that lasts for months or even years). Women with repeated episodes of PID are more likely to suffer infertility, ectopic pregnancy, or chronic pelvic pain.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance:

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention "right pelvic pain causes" or provide relevant information about it. Here are the passages that are most relevant to the query:

[2] Waist pain right side Save this for later. Pain along the waistline may be caused by abnormal function of any of the organs in the pelvic region of the body. Depending on the cause of the problem, waist pain might be mild or severe, aching or throbbing. Sitting and sleeping in improper position may lead to the pain located on the right side of the waist. This type of pain is more of an ache and it doesn't last for a long period of time in most cases.

[12] This condition can cause excruciating lower right abdominal pain when the stones are in the kidney or urethra. The pain can spread to the loin areas, especially when the need to urinate sets in.

[20] Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. This is a complication of sexually transmitted diseases. It's the No. 1 preventable cause of infertility in women. It can cause permanent damage to the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. Belly pain, fever, abnormal vaginal discharge, and pain during sex or urination can be symptoms. Get it treated right away to avoid damage.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance:

[Start] [20] > [12] > [2] [End]

[11] - These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures.

[12] - Gruber: Mackerel sharks, including great whites, makos, threshers, and porbeagles, have a heat-conserving mechanism known as the rete mirabile (wonderful net), a structure for warming blood passing over the gills.

[13] - Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warm-blooded (they are endotherms). These sharks can raise their temperature about the temperature of the water; they need to have occasional short bursts of speed in hunting.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly address the difference between a McDouble and a double cheeseburger. Based on the query, the following passages seem to be the most relevant:

[2] As with the invention of the hamburger, the exact origins of the cheeseburger are unknown. Several chefs claim to have been the first to add a slice of cheese to a hamburger. Lionel Sternberger of Rite Spot in Pasadena, California takes credit for the cheeseburger, claiming that he invented it between 1924 and 1926.

[7] If they are homemade, the calorie content of a double cheeseburger depends on the ingredients used and the quantities. If they are not homemade, here are a couple of examples.â¦ In a McDonald's, there are: approximately 440 to 459 calories. In a Burger King, there are: approximately 510 calories.

[8] There are 240 calories in a 1 sandwich serving of Burger King Double Cheeseburger (No Bun). Calorie breakdown: 71% fat, 7% carbs, 22% protein. Related Sandwiches from Burger King:

[16] There are these cheap a s s double cheeseburgers for only $1 at McDonalds. The wrapper says 25 grams of protein. Seems like a huge amount of protein for 2 shriveled up McDonalds burgers with bread and cheese.

Now, let's rank them in descending order:

[1] There are many items that can be purchased at McDonald's for just $1, really, just check their dollar menu! Here's a tip that not everyone knows... a McDouble from the McDonald's Dollar menu is the same thing as a Double Cheeseburger-well, minus one piece of cheese (and a lot of cents).

[3] A double cheeseburger has 2 slices of cheese with 2 meat patties. A mcdouble on the other hand only had 1 slice of cheese, but still 2 pieces of meat. I say had because mcdoubles arent sold in Australia (maybe a few stores but not a regular menu item) anymore. Other countries might be different but that's the difference in Australia.

Now, let's rank these two passages.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly compare the difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger. Based on that criteria, the following passages are relevant:

[1] There is a discernible difference between the two burgers, especially in the meat quality. The McDouble contains gristle and carry's a different flavor than the Double Cheeseburger. The double cheeseburger tastes more like beef. The McDouble tastes of whatever meat filler they use to fill the gap.

[3] At first glance, the double cheeseburger looks a lot like the McDouble, but it is not exactly the same thing. The main difference that you will notice is the amount of cheese that is on this sandwich. There are two slices of cheese on the double cheeseburger instead of just the one slice of cheese that comes on the McDouble. Even though it comes with two slices of cheese, it still has the onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard that come on the other burgers.

[4] But I did it for you. With McDonald's recent release of the McDouble, they now have three basic, sub-$2 cheeseburgers: the cheeseburger, McDouble (two patties with one slice of cheese), and double cheeseburger (two patties with two slices of cheese).

[8] The McDouble is listed as a slice of American cheese between two 100% beef patties, topped with pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard. mcdonalds.com. The Double Cheeseburger is listed as two slices of golden American cheese with two 100% all beef patties, pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the search query "types of dysarthria from cerebral palsy." Based on the provided passages, we can focus on passages that specifically mention dysarthria or discuss types of cerebral palsy related to speech and communication difficulties. Here are the relevant passages:

[9] Children with cerebral palsy often have a disability that renders them unable to communicate. To complicate issues more, if the child has a severe form of cerebral palsy, he or she may not be able to write, type, point, or sign.
[12] Dyskinetic Athetoid Cerebral Palsy. Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy, also known as athetoid cerebral palsy or ADCP, is a form of cerebral palsy marked by involuntary movement. It's not as common as spastic cerebral palsy but it's not as rare as ataxic cerebral palsy. Dyskinetic/Athetoid cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain's basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is responsible for submitting messages to the body to help coordinate and control movements. When it's damaged, voluntary movements are compromised, resulting in spasticity and other abnormal movements.

Now, let's rank these relevant passages.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the search query. Based on the query "types of dysarthria from cerebral palsy," the following passages are most relevant:

[3] The types of cerebral palsy are: 1 spastic: the most common type of cerebral palsy; reflexes are exaggerated and muscle movement is stiff. 2 dyskinetic: dyskinetic cerebral palsy is divided into two categories.

[8] Motor disability types of CP. Spastic: Spastic cerebral palsy causes movements to be stiff or difficult to execute. In these types of cerebral palsy the muscles may not be able to relax properly. Ataxic: In Ataxic cerebral palsy, balance and coordinated movements are difficult to achieve.

[12] Dyskinetic Athetoid Cerebral Palsy. Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy, also known as athetoid cerebral palsy or ADCP, is a form of cerebral palsy marked by involuntary movement. It's not as common as spastic cerebral palsy but it's not as rare as ataxic cerebral palsy. Dyskinetic/Athetoid cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain's basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is responsible for submitting messages to the body to help coordinate and control movements. When it's damaged, voluntary movements are compromised, resulting in spasticity and other abnormal movements.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the search query "rsa definition key." 

First, let's look for passages that specifically mention RSA and provide a definition or explanation of the key aspect. Based on this criteria, the following passages seem relevant:

[1] RSA-SHA1 Signature Suite-Version 1.0. RSA is a public-key cryptosystem for both encryption and authentication. This signature suite specifies how it is used with the SHA1 hash function to sign a PICS label per the DSig 1.0 Specification.

[5] RSA involves a public key and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encrypting messages. Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted in a reasonable amount of time using the private key.

[6] RSA involves a public key and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encrypting messages. The intention is that messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted in a reasonable amount of time using the private key.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the search query "medicare's definition of mechanical ventilation." 

Based on the query, the following passages seem to be the most relevant:

[1] Principles of artiï¬cial ventilation Tim Gould J M A de Beer Abstract Ventilators are commonly used in the operating theatre and in the ICU to deliver mechanical ventilation to the lungs. In the operating theatre, ventilation is given to anaesthetized and often pharmacologically para-lysed patients with predominantly normal lungs. These ventilators are

[6] The Bird VIP Infant ventilator. A medical ventilator (or simply ventilator in context) is a mechanical ventilator, a machine designed to move breathable air into and out of the lungs, to provide breathing for a patient who is physically unable to breathe, or breathing insufficiently.

[10] Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Depending on the patientâs condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.

[12] This form of mechanical ventilation includes pressure control ventilation (PCV), pressure support ventilation (PSV), and several noninvasive modalities applied via a tight-fitting face mask. In all of these modalities, the ventilator delivers a set inspiratory pressure.

[15] This article reviews assisted ventilation of the newborn, highlighting the concepts of pulmonary mechanics, gas exchange, respiration control, and lung injury that can be used to enhance conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) so as to improve survival and reduce adverse effects.

[15] - Ventilation is completely provided by the mechanical ventilator with a preset tidal volume, respiratory rate, and oxygen concentration prescribed by the physician. -Ventilator totally controls the patient's ventilation i.e. the ventilator initiates and controls both the volume delivered and the frequency of breath.
[19] Assisted ventilation. Definition: application of mechanically or manually generated positive pressure to gas(es) in or about the airway during inhalation as a means of augmenting the movement of gases into the lungs. Synonym(s): assisted respiration. Search Stedman's Medical Dictionary.
[20] Mechanical ventilation can decrease the patient's work of breathing by unloading respiratory muscles in a synchronous manner. Mechanical ventilation can also maintain long-term respiratory support of patients with chronic ventilatory problems.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance:

[4] Medical Definition of Mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation: Use of a machine called a ventilator or respirator to improve the exchange of air between the lungs and the atmosphere. Last Editorial Review: 5/13/2016.

[12] Mechanical ventilation is the medical term for artificial ventilation where mechanical means is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing.

[13] Mechanical ventilation. For the use in architecture and climate control, see Ventilation (architecture). Mechanical ventilation is the medical term for artificial ventilation where mechanical means is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing.

[14] Ventilators are medical devices that provide mechanical ventilation to assist with or replace patientsâ spontaneous breathing. Mechanical ventilation is often categorized based on the interface used, such as a tracheostomy tube for invasive ventilation, or a mask for non-invasive ventilation.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the query "example of monotonic function." 

Based on the query, the following passages seem to be the most relevant:

[2] Absorbance is dimensionless, and in particular is not a length, though it is a monotonically increasing function of path length, and approaches zero as the path length approaches zero. The use of the term optical density for absorbance is discouraged. In physics, a closely related quantity called optical depth is used instead of absorbance: the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power through a material. The optical depth equals the absorbance times ln(10).

[8] Figure 1b plots average naiveBayes error and average class-conditional mutual informa-tion between the two features, *(!(, , as functionsof (the other two plots in the ï¬gure will be discussedshortly). Note the monotone increase of the naive Bayeserror and the non-monotone behavior of the mutual infor-mation.

[12] As an example, if you set: x=(1:100); y=exp(x); % then, corr(x,y,'type','Spearman'); % will equal 1, and corr(x,y,'type','Pearson'); % will be about equal to 0.25 This is because $y$ increases monotonically with $x$ so the Spearman correlation is perfect, but not linearly, so the Pearson correlation is imperfect. corr(x,log(y),'type','Pearson'); % ...

[4] A misunderstood statistic: 22 military veteran suicides a day. In most discussions of suicide and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan â including the online buzz that followed publication of a Times analysis on how young California veterans die â one statistic gets repeated most: 22 veterans kill themselves each day.

[12] Among key findings: while suicide rates for soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan more than doubled from 2004 to 2009 to more than 30-per-100,000, the trend among those who never deployed nearly tripled to between 25- and 30-per-100,000. Suicide rates soared among soldiers who went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan and those who never left the United States, according to the largest study ever conducted on suicide in the military.

[1] Figures on the third quarters of 2015 and 2014 showed suicides in the active duty Navy increased to 11 from seven; in the active duty Air Force to 16 from 13; and in the active duty Army to 32 from 31. Through all of 2014, the number of suicides recorded for the active duty military was 273, and for the reserves it was 170, for a total of 443. Through the first three quarters of 2015, the number of suicides for active duty was 202 and the number for the reserves was 161, for a total of 363.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the query "causes of military suicide." Based on the query, we can eliminate passages that are not directly related to military suicide or do not provide information about its causes. Here are the relevant passages:

[1] In the 2008 movie "Valkyrie," about the July plot actor Tom Cruise portrayed Claus von Stauffenberg. The men behind the July Plot were a group of high-level German military leaders who recognized that Hitler was leading Germany in a suicidal war on two fronts.

[2] The new arithmetic shows that from 2006 forward — during the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan — the true suicide rate across the U.S. military was actually several tenths of a percent to 1% or more higher than what was being reported.

[5] During World War II, the strategy of the suicide pilots was developed as a way to buy time to rebuild their military.

[11] Then, as the two stood just steps apart, Michael saluted, raised a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. Suicide Is Now the Leading Cause of Death Amongst Active-Duty Soldiers. In 2010, for the second year in a row, more American soldiers killed themselves than died in combat. Military officials knew they had an epidemic on their hands, but they didn't know how to mitigate the hyper-complex problem.

[12] Among key findings: while suicide rates for soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan more than doubled from 2004 to 2009 to more than 30-per-100,000, the trend among those who never deployed nearly tripled to between 25- and 30-per-100,000.

[13] The suicide rate for men in the Army National Guard was 34.2-per-100,000, Pentagon data shows. For full-time troops across the U.S. military, the suicide rate peaked at 22.7-per-100,000 in 2012 and fell to 19.1-per-100,000 last year, according to the Pentagon.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the query "what types of food can you cook sous vide." Based on the content of the passages, the following passages are likely to provide information about the types of food that can be cooked sous vide:

[2] All kinds! Any type of meatâsuch as beef, pork, lamb, game, or poultryâis ideal for sous vide. It works especially well with fish and seafood, ensuring that these delicate foods are not overcooked. Almost any vegetable can also be cooked sous vide with delicious results, as can eggs and many fruits. You can even use it to make custard-style ice cream base, bÃ©arnaise sauce, crÃ¨me Anglaise, custards, cheese, yogurt, and even cakes.

[13] Cook them sous vide. With the precision of sous vide cooking, you can ensure that the juices and flavor stay packed inside that pork chop, right where they belong. Here's a tip: If you're cooking for two, instead of two skinny pork chops, get yourself one big, fat, double-cut chop and split it at the table.

[14] Itâs no secret that Heston Blumenthal, the master of molecular gastronomy, is a fan of sous vide cooking. This recipe is inspired by his sous vide scrambled eggs recipe. The eggs are so smooth, light, and creamy that youâll hardly realize they're simply scrambled eggs.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention or define exons in the context of biology. Based on that, we can rank them accordingly. Here are the relevant passages:

[2] Description: In most eukaryotic genes, coding regions (exons) are interrupted by noncoding regions (introns). During transcription, the entire gene is copied into a pre-mRNA, which includes exons and introns. During the process of RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons joined to form a contiguous coding sequence. This mature mRNA is ready for translation.

[3] Introns are intervening sequences-not expressed in proteins. Exons are retained in the mature mRNA molecules. Exon and intron lengths and numbers vary in various genes.

[8] Exons are coding areas whereas introns are non-coding areas. An exon is termed as a nucleic acid sequence which is represented in the RNA molecule. Introns, on the other hand, are termed as nucleotide sequences seen within the genes which are removed through RNA splicing for generating a mature RNA molecule. Exons can be termed as DNA bases which are translated into mRNA. Introns are also DNA bases that are found in between exons. Introns are very much common in the genome of higher vertebrates such as human beings and mice but unlikely to be seen in the genome of certain varieties of eukaryotic micro-organisms.

[10] A genomic library will contain all the exons, introns, and transcriptional factors that are not found in the cDNA library. cDNA library does contain exons, which are the protein coding regions. They contain no introns.

[17] Two isozymes are encoded by the PKM gene: PKM1 and PKM2. The M-gene consists of 12 exons and 11 introns. PKM1 and PKM2 are different splicing products of the M-gene (exon 9 for PKM1 and exon 10 for PKM2) and solely differ in 23 amino acids within a 56-amino acid stretch (aa 378-434) at their carboxy terminus.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance to the search query.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention the causes of left ventricular hypertrophy. Based on the information provided, the following passages are relevant to the query:

[2] High Blood Pressure and Afib. High blood pressure (hypertension) is one of the major causes of all kinds of heart problems from heart attack to stroke to enlargement of the heart. (see ventricular hypertrophy).

[4] COZAAR is a prescription medicine called an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). It is used: 1 alone or with other blood pressure medicines to lower high blood pressure (hypertension). 2 to lower the chance of stroke in patients with high blood pressure and a heart problem called left ventricular hypertrophy. 3 COZAAR may not help Black patients with this problem.

[5] High blood pressure and heart disease. Hypertensive heart disease is the number one cause of death associated with high blood pressure. It is actually a group of disorders that include heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy (excessive thickening of the heart muscle).

[8] As enlargement progresses, though, the heart's pumping ability declines. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the main type of cardiomegaly. In dilated cardiomyopathy, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of enlarged heart, the heart's muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. High blood pressure usually causes left ventricular enlargement (hypertrophy), while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an inherited condition.

[10] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) occurs when the muscle tissue in the heart's main pumping chamber becomes enlarged. LVH is often caused by high blood pressure or other heart problems and can lead to serious complications, such as heart disease, heart attack, and heart failure.

[12] In a patient with a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, these high-risk factors include a prior cardiac arrest, family history of premature cardiac death, spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia or multiple episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitor, multiple episodes of syncope or pre-syncope, extreme left ventricular hypertrophy (wall thickness >30 mm), or exercise-induced hypotension.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention the causes of left ventricular hypertrophy. Based on the information provided, the following passages are relevant to the query:

[4] Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.

[5] By Mayo Clinic Staff. Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension.

[14] Lifestyle changes can help lower your blood pressure and improve left ventricular hypertrophy signs. Consider: Weight loss. Left ventricular hypertrophy is often found in obese people regardless of blood pressure. Losing weight has been shown to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy. Limiting salt in your diet.

[15] Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in people who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. But no matter what your blood pressure is, developing left ventricular hypertrophy puts you at higher risk for a heart attack and stroke. Treating high blood pressure can help ease your symptoms and may reverse left ventricular hypertrophy.

[1] Best Answer: No, they don't. I'll give two examples of cells without plastids: Sieve tube elements and water conducting xylem cells. Sieve tube elements are living cells without plastids or nuclei (they are run by their companion cells, which house the nuclei and necessary organelles). Water conducting xylem cells, like tracheids and vessels, are dead at maturity and therefore don't have plastids. Source(s): plantgirl Â· 9 years ago.
[2] The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water. Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.Xylem also contains two other cell types: parenchyma and fibers.Xylem can be found: 1 in vascular bundles, present in non-woody plants and non-woody parts of woody plants. 2 in secondary xylem, laid down by a meristem called the vascular cambium in woody plants.
[3] Water molecules move from the soil into living cells of the root, and eventually into the transport cells of the xylem, known as tracheids and vessels.
[5] There are two different types of water conducting tissues in vascular plants, both of which are constituted as xylem, they are tracheids, and vessel elements.
[10] Xylem tracheids are pointed, elongated xylem cells, the simplest of which have continuous primary cell walls and lignified secondary wall thickenings in the form of rings, hoops, or reticulate networks.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention tracheids as part of something. Here are the relevant passages:

[1] While parenchyma cells do occur within what is commonly termed the xylem, the more identifiable cells, tracheids and vessel elements, tend to stain red with Safranin-O. Tracheids are the more primitive of the two cell types, occurring in the earliest vascular plants.

[2] In most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element.

[5] Xylem also contains two other cell types: parenchyma and fibers. Xylem consists of tracheids, vessels, xylem parenchyma, and xylem fibers.

[10] Xylem consists of three different types of cells: Xylem parenchyma cells and xylem fiber cells, which simply provide structural support for the most important xylem cells, the tracheary elements (TE).

[11] Xylem tracheids are pointed, elongated xylem cells, the simplest of which have continuous primary cell walls and lignified secondary wall thickenings in the form of rings, hoops, or reticulate networks.

[13] The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water. Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention tracheids as part of something. Here are the relevant passages:

[1] The xylem tracheary elements consist of cells known as tracheids and vessel members, both of which are typically narrow, hollow, and elongated. Tracheids are less specialized than the vessel members and are the only type of water-conducting cells in most gymnosperms and seedless vascular plants.
[3] While parenchyma cells do occur within what is commonly termed the xylem the more identifiable cells, tracheids and vessel elements, tend to stain red with Safranin-O. Tracheids are the more primitive of the two cell types, occurring in the earliest vascular plants.
[5] The xylem tracheary elements consist of cells known as tracheids and vessel members, both of which are typically narrow, hollow, and elongated. Tracheids are less specialized than the vessel members and are the only type of water-conducting cells in most gymnosperms and seedless vascular plants.
[7] In most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes.
[11] Xylem tracheids are pointed, elongated xylem cells, the simplest of which have continuous primary cell walls and lignified secondary wall thickenings in the form of rings, hoops, or reticulate networks.
[19] The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water. Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance to the query "tracheids are part of _____."

[1] Xylem is consists of two types of cells known as tracheids and vessel elements.
[2] In most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells.
[3] Xylem is made up of xylem vessels, tracheids, xylem parenchyma, and xylem fibers.

[5] Its major components include xylem parenchyma, xylem fibers, tracheids, and xylem vessels.
[6] Tracheids are the more primitive of the two cell types, occurring in the earliest vascular plants.
[7] Woody angiosperms have also vessels. The mature tracheids form a column of superposed, cylindrical dead cells whose end walls have been perforated, resulting in a continuous tube called vessel (trachea).
[10] Tracheids are found in the xylem of all higher plants except certain angiosperms, such as cereals and sedges, in which the water-conducting function is performed by vessels, or tracheae.
[11] Tracheids are less specialized than the vessel members and are the only type of water-conducting cells in most gymnosperms and seedless vascular plants.

[1] Thank you... In plants xylem and phloem are the complex tissues which are the components parts of conductive system. In higher plants xylem contains tracheids, vessels (tracheae), xylem fibres(wood fibres) and xylem parenchyma (wood parenchyma).
[3] Tracheids and vessel elements form tube-shaped structures that provide pathways for water and minerals to travel from the roots to the leaves. While tracheids are found in all vascular plants, vessels are found only in angiosperms.
[5] While tracheids are found in all vascular plants, vessels are found only in angiosperms. Phloem is composed mostly of cells called sieve-tube cells and companion cells. These cells assist in the transport of sugar and nutrients produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
[6] Summary: Vessels have perforations at the end plates while tracheids do not have end plates. Tracheids are derived from single individual cells while vessels are derived from a pile of cells. Tracheids are present in all vascular plants whereas vessels are confined to angiosperms.
[7] While tracheids are found in all vascular plants, vessels are found only in angiosperms. Phloem is composed mostly of cells called sieve-tube cells and companion cells. These cells assist in the transport of sugar and nutrients produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
[9] The main cells of xylem are tracheids and vessel elements (these are only found in angiosperms). Tracheids and vessel elements are dead cells that have lost their cytoplasm. Only their cell wall impregnated with lignin (an impermeable biopolymer) remains.
[11] Xylem is made up of xylem vessels, tracheids, xylem parenchyma, and xylem fibers. Xylem vessels are tubelike structures joined end to end. Tracheids are elongated narrow cells. They are dead cells.
[14] Tracheid of oak shows pits along the walls. It is longer than a vessel element and has no perforation plates. Tracheids are elongated cells in the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts. Tracheids are one of two types of tracheary elements, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids, unlike vessel elements, do not have perforation plates.
[15] Its major components include xylem parenchyma, xylem fibers, tracheids, and xylem vessels. Tracheids are one of the two types of tracheary elements of vascular plants. (The other being the vessel elements). A tracheid cell loses its protoplast at maturity. Thus, at maturity, it becomes one of the non-living components of the xylem.
[17] Woody angiosperms have also vessels. The mature tracheids form a column of superposed, cylindrical dead cells whose end walls have been perforated, resulting in a continuous tube called vessel (trachea). Tracheids are found in all vascular plants and are the only conducting elements in gymnosperms and ferns.

What is the most popular food in Ohio? A number of foods and food products originated in Northeast Ohio, like Stadium Mustard and Scoffer's Dinners. Others have become so ingrained into the fabric of the city as to be native, like paczki, those Polish doughnuts that proliferate just before Lent.

[4] The food of the Swiss is unusual in that it has so many regional influences from the cuisine of its neighbors. This includes the French, German, and Italians. Historically, Switzerland was a farming country, and the most popular crops and foods include cheese and potatoes as well as chocolate.

[5] What To Eat In Switzerland: 5 Foods Beyond Fondue. By on March 22, 2013, in Switzerland. Switzerland does dairy well – the molten variety in particular. There's something rather brilliant about eating hot bubbling cheese or chocolate while you sit nestled among the snowy Alps, and this a scene the Swiss have nailed.

[12] Food of Switzerland. Traditional Food in Switzerland. There are many different dishes in Switzerland that are regional. Italian food is very common in modern Switzerland including pasta and pizza. Swiss cheese includes Emmental cheese, Vacherin, and Appenzeller.

[13] In the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, the Ticino area, one will find a type of restaurant unique to the region. The Grotto is a rustic eatery, offering traditional food ranging from pasta to homemade meat specialties. Popular dishes are Luganighe and Luganighetta, a type of artisan sausages.

[14] The word "Kirschwasser" is German for "cherry water" and is the name of a clear brandy popular in Germany and Switzerland. These two countries are the most famous producers of the cherry brandy Kirschwasser. German Kirschwasser is believed to originate in South Germany, in the region of the Black Forest.

[11] Spruces (Picea) 1 Spruce needles are generally stiff and sharp; about 1 long. 2 Each spruce needle springs from a tiny, woody peg. 3 Most spruce cones have papery thin scales. 4 Most spruce bark is thin and flaky.

[13] Norway Spruce. Â­. Color/Appearance: Norway Spruce is typically a creamy white, with a hint of yellow and/or red. Grain/Texture: Norway Spruce has a fine, even texture, and a consistently straight grain.Rot Resistance: Heartwood is rated as being slightly resistant to non-resistant to decay.

[7] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States.

[14] Least Concern (IUCN 3.1) The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States.

[15] Common Name: Blue Spruce, Colorado Spruce. Picea abies Common Name: Norway Spruce . About the Spruce Tree . Spruce trees are coniferous (needle-leafed) evergreens. There are about 35 species in the genus Picea, native to the northern hemisphere. The name spruce is from the Latin pix, meaning pitch. These trees often live to a very old age. The oldest spruce on record is a Picea engelmannii that reached 852 years and is still thriving.

[19] The black spruce (Picea mariana) is one of 8 species of coniferous or evergreen trees that are native to Manitoba.This group of plants belong to a larger group called the Gymnosperms.runk of a black spruce. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm).

[6] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping, however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe.runk of a black spruce. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm).

[16] Sitka spruce, (Picea sitchensis,) known also as tideland spruce, coast spruce, and yellow spruce, is the largest of the world's spruces and is one of the most prominent forest trees in stands along the northwest coast of North America. Alaska didn't become a state, officially, until 1959. House Bill No. 325 proposed the Sitka spruce, the most valuable tree species in Alaska, as the official state tree of Alaska.

[12] conifer; coniferous tree (any gymnospermous tree or shrub bearing cones) Meronyms (substance of spruce): spruce (light soft moderately strong wood of spruce trees; used especially for timbers and millwork) Hyponyms (each of the following is a kind of spruce): Picea obovata; Siberian spruce (tall spruce of northern Europe and Asia; resembles Norway spruce)

[1] Thoughts on why Chaucer didn't give a Physical Description Chaucer doesn't give a huge physical description of the Parson because his morals are far more important than his physical description. Resources:

[2] What is a network topology? In communication networks, a topology is a usually schematic description of the arrangement of a network, including its nodes and connecting lines. There are two ways of defining network geometry: the physical topology and the logical (or signal) topology. The physical topology of a network is the actual geometric layout of workstations. There are several common physical topologies, as described below and as shown in the illustration.

[3] There are many specialty areas in the field of physical therapy. Although this is well known throughout the profession, it is often overlooked by the general public. Below is a brief description of the five most common specialty areas in physical therapy. Read on to find out what specialty area is most appropriate for you or your family member. Orthopedic Physical Therapy. Orthopedic physical therapists diagnose, manage and treat disorders and injuries of the musculoskeletal system.

[8] A physical education teacher should enjoy the active lifestyle and be able to communicate health concepts to students in various age groups. This guide provides further information on what physical education teachers do, how to become a physical education teacher, and physical education teacher salary and outlook. Physical Education Teacher Job Description. A physical education teacher instructs students about sports, physical development, health, and proper nutrition. A PE teacher has knowledge of sports and the health sciences. Physical education teachers show students not only how to play various sports, but also how physical activity benefits the muscles and overall health.

[10] DECIDING WHAT TYPE OF STRUCTURE A SUBSTANCE HAS This page explains how you can decide what sort of structure a substance has by looking at its physical properties. The page originally had a brief kinetic theory description of solids, liquids and gases.educing the type of bonding from physical properties. Melting and boiling points. The best place to start is usually the physical state. Melting point isn't always a good guide to the size of the attractions between particles, because the attractive forces have only been loosened on melting-not broken entirely.

[17] The spire-like FORM is not as acute as balsam fir. It is difficult to tell spruces apart. White spruce has longer needles that black spruce, but this doesn't help much unless you have two samples in-hand to compare. The best way to distinguish between these two similar species is to look at your feet. If you're standing in a wetland, it's probably black spruce. If you're on an upland site, it's probably white spruce. Two alien spruces are common in the U.P., Norway spruce and Colorado blue spruce. Mostly a family of the northern hemisphere, the Pinaceae have 9 genera and about 210 species.

Color/Appearance: Norway Spruce is typically a creamy white, with a hint of yellow and/or red. Grain/Texture: Norway Spruce has a fine, even texture, and a consistently straight grain.

[12] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping, however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe.runk of a black spruce. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm).

[5] What is Cytospora canker? Cytospora canker is one of the most common fungal diseases of Colorado blue spruce. This disease can also affect Norway spruce (and less frequently other spruces) as well as Douglas-fir and balsam fir. Trees that are 15 years old or older and are at least 20 feet high most typically show symptoms of this disease.

[5] DISTRIBUTION OF ACTIVE VOLCANOES. The earth is a dynamic planet. Its rigid outer surface layer is broken into several tectonic plates which are in constant motion relative to one another. As demonstrated in the world map below, most of the ~550 active volcanoes on earth are located along the margins of adjacent plates.

[7] The continental arc is formed at an active continental margin where two tectonic plates meet and a subduction zone develops. The magmatism and petrogenesis of continental crust is complicated: in essence, continental arcs reflect a mixture of oceanic crust materials, mantle wedge, and continental crust materials.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most directly relevant to the query "what is an active margin." Based on the query, the following passages are likely to be the most relevant:

[1] Profile illustrating the shelf, slope and rise. The continental margin is the zone of the ocean floor that separates the thin oceanic crust from thick continental crust.Together, the continental shelf, continental slope, and continental rise are called continental margin. Continental margins constitute about 28% of the oceanic area.arthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common on the west coast of North America, but there are no active volcanoes on the east coast and large magnitude earthquakes are rare. Geologists refer to the west coast as (tectonically) active continental margin and the east coast a passive continental margin.

[6] An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.

[12] Active continental margin: A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope that ends in a deep trench instead of a continental rise; it is marked by earthquake and volcanic activity.

[13] An active plate margin is an actual plate boundary, where oceanic crust and continental crust crash into each other. Active plate margins are often the site of earthquakes and volcanoes. Oceanic crust created by seafloor spreading in the East Pacific Rise, for instance, may become part of the Ring of Fire, the horseshoe-shaped pattern of volcanoes and earthquake zones around the Pacific ocean basin.

[3] Conservation tillage can be an economical option for farmers, plus provides a number of potential environmental benefits: 1 Reduced plowing makes cropland much less vulnerable to soil erosion: conservation tillage reduces soil erosion by as much as 90 percent, compared to systems using intensive tillage.

[11] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion.

[12] Contour ploughing follows the "natural shape" of the slope without altering it. Terrace farming alters the shape of the slope to produce flat areas that provide a catchment for water.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention what contour plowing can reduce. Based on the query, passages that mention reducing soil erosion or preventing soil erosion would be relevant. Here are the passages that mention reducing soil erosion:

[4] Contour plowing was a method of plowing furrows that follow the curves of the land rather than straight up and down slopes. Furrows that run up and down a slope form a channel that can quickly carry away seeds and topsoil. Contour plowing forms ridges, slows the water flow and helps save precious topsoil. LeRoy Hoffman rented farmland for his entire farming career and remembers when the government urged farmers to change their plowing methods.

[9] Both contour plowing and terrace farming are suitable for cultivating lands on sloping hills. Both are used to reduce soil erosion from tilled fields on slopes. In terrace farming, physical barriers (trenches, stone bunds, live hedges, or natural strips) are created along the contours to retain rainwater and make it infiltrate into the soil and to minimize soil erosion.

[11] A: Contour plowing conserves soil by following the lay of the land and creating ridges that form a water break to prevent soil erosion. Furrows that do not follow the lay of the land cause rapid runoff during rainfall by forming a convenient channel for the water to flow downhill.

[13] One of the earliest methods of conservation tillage came to be known as contour plowing, or plowing on the contour. Tilling the soil along the gentle slopes of a piece of cropland, instead of up and down the gradient, prevents fertile topsoil from being carried downhill by flowing rainwater.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance to the query.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly address the query "does legionella pneumophila cause pneumonia." Based on that, we can create a preliminary ranking. Here are the passages that directly address the query:

[2] About the Disease. Legionnaires' disease is a severe, often lethal, form of pneumonia. It's caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila found in both potable and nonpotable water systems.

[3] Legionellosis is an infection that is caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila. The disease has two distinct forms: 1 Legionnaires' disease is the more severe form of the infection, which may involve pneumonia.

[8] Causes. The bacterium Legionella pneumophila is responsible for most cases of Legionnaires' disease. Outdoors, legionella bacteria survive in soil and water, but rarely cause infections.

[11] Legionnaire disease is an infection of the lungs and airways. It is caused by Legionella bacteria. The bacteria that cause Legionnaire disease have been found in water delivery systems. They can survive in the warm, moist air conditioning systems of large buildings, including hospitals. Most cases are caused by the bacteria Legionella pneumophila. The rest of the cases are caused by other Legionella species.

[12] Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia. It is caused by bacteria called Legionella pneumophila.

[13] Legionnaires disease (LD) was recognized in 1976 after an outbreak of pneumonia at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia. Soon after, the etiologic agent was identified as a fastidious gram-negative bacillus and named Legionella pneumophila.

[14] Legionnaires' disease, or Legionellosis, is a severe infection caused by Legionella species, primarily L. pneumophila. In fact, L. pneumophila is responsible for 90% of infections.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance to the query:

[1] Other bacteria types that can cause pneumonia include the bacteria that cause so-called atypical pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumonia. The most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults is the influenza virus. A number of different respiratory viruses cause pneumonia in children, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). While viral pneumonia tends to be less severe than bacterial pneumonia, there is a risk of developing secondary bacterial pneumonia when viral pneumonia is present.

[3] Definition. Pneumonia is an infection of the lung. With atypical pneumonia, the infection is caused by different bacteria than the ones that cause typical pneumonia. These include Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Atypical pneumonia also tends to have milder symptoms than typical pneumonia.

[5] Legionnaires' disease, or Legionellosis, is a severe infection caused by Legionella species, primarily L. pneumophila. In fact, L. pneumophila is responsible for 90% of infections. The disease typically presents as pneumonia and symptoms may include a high fever, chills, cough, muscle aches, headaches, and diarrhea.

[2] The special combination of herbs and spices used in preparing Thai dishes is what gives Thai food its very distinctive character. There are about 20 main herbs and spices which form the basis for Thai cooking. Most Thai cooks don't use food processors, ovens, micro sieves or other fancy devices. Most don't even use measuring spoons but tend to cook like our grandmothers — they just know.

[5] What we want are places that serve authentic and delicious Thai food, where the Thais themselves love to eat. We have been in Bangkok several times, often staying for long periods of a few months at a time, and have tried a lot of Thai restaurants both indoors and on the streets.

[8] Since many Thai people understand some English, this would not be a problem at all. However, being able to say some simple words and basic phrases like "hello" and "thank you" is fun for the tourist and would be appreciated by many Thais. Below is a list of some common words and some useful phrases in Thai for tourists.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the query "is cdg airport in main paris." 

Based on the query, the following passages are likely to be the most relevant:

[11] CDG may refer to: 1 Caisse de dÃ©pÃ´t et de gestion, Moroccan pension fund. 2 Charles de Gaulle, French general and politician. IATA code for Charles de Gaulle Airport, in Paris, France.

[12] CDG Terminal 1 to Paris If youâre arriving at CDG Terminal 1, youâll first need to take the CDGVAL shuttle train to Terminal 3/Roissypole (center of map) to catch the RER B train to Paris.

[19] The regular RER trains will make about 9 stops in between CDG Airport and Gare du Nord. Youâll save roughly 12 minutes by taking one of the express trains, but even the non-express RER B will get you to Paris (Gare du Nord) in about 34 minutes. Enjoy your visit!

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the query "is cdg airport in main paris." 

Based on the query, the following passages are likely to be the most relevant:

[1] There are nine terminals at Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) airport â 1, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F, 2G and 3. The CDGVAL service and the free airport shuttle service connects them all and each has shops, restaurants and services.

[2] Outside of the home hubs of A380 operators â Singapore, Dubai, Sydney, Melbourne, Paris CDG, Frankfurt and Seoul Incheon â the most important airports are New York JFK and Tokyo Narita. These airports have four airlines flying A380s to/from them.

[3] Average journey time between Paris-Gare du Nord and CDG airport is 35 minutes. Preferred express (direct) train, local trains stop at suburban stations on their way into the city/the airport. Trains run every 6 to 15 minutes. You can purchase tickets at any metro, RER station (airport included).

[5] Apr 26, 2013, 9:21 AM. ORY is the closest airport to central Paris by a good margin, about 20 to 30 minutes by taxi. CDG is about 45 minutes by taxi. BVA is way out of Paris and any transportation into Paris, other than the special bus to Port Maillot, could easily cost you double what you might otherwise pay for ground transportation.

[9] Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) to Eiffel Tower - Paris. I have 2 questions about Pairs and need some suggestions. This summer, I will arrive the Charles De Gaulle Airport in the morning about 9:00 and will transit to Budapest at 18:00 on the same day. I believe that I will have enough time to go to the Eiffel Tower.

[11] CDG may refer to: 1 Caisse de dÃ©pÃ´t et de gestion, Moroccan pension fund. 2 Charles de Gaulle, French general and politician. IATA code for Charles de Gaulle Airport, in Paris, France.

[13] CDG Terminal 1 to Paris If youâre arriving at CDG Terminal 1, youâll first need to take the CDGVAL shuttle train to Terminal 3/Roissypole (center of map) to catch the RER B train to Paris.

[14] The cost is about the same to fly into either CDG or Orly (Â£63 or Â£65) with British Airways. Wondering what the pros or cons would be for getting into Paris from either airport. Orly does look closer. Not sure where we are staying yet but considering Hotel Saint Germain. Any help in deciding which airport to fly into would be greatly appreciated!

[15] Transport between Orly and Roissy-CDG airports: To get to Orly Airport from CDG Airport, take the RER-B (direction Massy Palaiseau or Saint-Remy-rÃ©my-Les) lÃ¨s Chevreuse to, antony station and then Take. the orlyvalo get to Orly Airport from CDG Airport, take the RER-B (direction Massy Palaiseau or Saint-Remy-rÃ©my-Les) lÃ¨s Chevreuse to, antony station and then Take. The orlyval Traveling from ORLY, to cdg Take the Orlyval to, antony station THEN-The rer B To aeroport AÃ©roport. charles de gaulle

[16] The Paris Visite ticket is available in only two zone choices: 1-3 or 1-5. (To travel from CDG or Orly Airports to central Paris, youâll need the 1-5 zone Paris Visite ticket). Paris Visite can be purchased with 1, 2, 3 or 5 days of use.aris RER travel passes are subject to fare zones, 1 through 5, which determine the price of the multi-use pass or ticket. The above transit fares are valid for travel not only on the RER, but also on the Metro and Buses within the fare zone you have purchased.

[17] The regular RER trains will make about 9 stops in between CDG Airport and Gare du Nord. Youâll save roughly 12 minutes by taking one of the express trains, but even the non-express RER B will get you to Paris (Gare du Nord) in about 34 minutes. Enjoy your visit!

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly define or explain the term "visceral." Based on that, we can proceed with the ranking. Here are the passages that provide a definition or explanation of the term:

[5] Definition of Visceral. Visceral: Referring to the viscera, the internal organs of the body, specifically those within the chest (as the heart or lungs) or abdomen (as the liver, pancreas or intestines). In a figurative sense, something visceral is felt deep down.. It is a gut feeling..
[15] The lungs are surrounded by a double membrane called pleura. This membrane has two layers, a parietal pleura and a visceral pleura. The parietal pleura is attached to the chest wall and the visceral pleura covers the surface of the lungs.
[19] The lungs are surrounded by a double membrane called pleura. This membrane has two layers, a parietal pleura and a visceral pleura.The parietal pleura is attached to the chest wall and the visceral pleura covers the surface of the lungs.
[20] In between the parietal and visceral pericardial layers there is a potential space called the pericardial cavity, which contains a supply of lubricating serous fluid known as the pericardial fluid. When the visceral layer comes into contact with heart (not the great vessels) it is known as the epicardium.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance to the query "define visceral?":

[Start] [5] > [15] > [19] > [20] [End]

Please note that this is an initial ranking based on the passages that directly define or explain the term "visceral." We can further refine the ranking if needed.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly define or explain the term "visceral." Based on that, we can create a preliminary ranking. Here are the passages that provide a definition or explanation of the term:

[11] Definition of Visceral. Visceral: Referring to the viscera, the internal organs of the body, specifically those within the chest (as the heart or lungs) or abdomen (as the liver, pancreas or intestines). In a figurative sense, something visceral is felt deep down.. It is a gut feeling.
[15] The visceral pleura is all of the serous membrane that is in direct contact with the lung. The parietal pleura is everything else. The same is true of the pericardium: if it directly touches the heart, it is visceral, but if it only contacts other tissue (including visceral pleura), it is parietal.
[19] The body of the first visceral motor neuron lies in the CNS, and the body of the second visceral motor neuron lies in an autonomic ganglion (e.g., the sympathetic trunk ganglia). Visceral motor neurons that originate in the CNS are called preganglionic neurons.

Now, let's rank these passages:

[Start] [11] > [15] > [19] [End]

Please note that this is a preliminary ranking based on the passages that directly define or explain the term "visceral." We will continue refining the ranking in the next steps.
