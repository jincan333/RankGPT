 original response: Passage [11] and [12] directly answer the query by providing the temperature at which hydrogen becomes a liquid. Passages [6], [13], [14], [15], and [16] also mention the temperature at which hydrogen changes state, but they are not as specific as [11] and [12]. Passages [1], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], [17], [18], [19], and [20] are less relevant as they discuss hydrogen or other substances in different contexts without directly answering the query.

Reasoning for relevance:

[2] - Directly explains exons, introns, and their roles in transcription and translation.
[3] - Briefly mentions exons and introns, and provides an example of a gene with varying exon and intron lengths.
[8] - Compares exons and introns, and provides information about their roles in DNA and RNA.
[10] - Discusses the presence of exons and introns in genomic and cDNA libraries.
[16] - Mentions exons and introns in the context of amplifying specific gene fragments.
[17] - Describes the structure of the PKM gene and the role of exons in encoding isozymes.

[1], [4], [5], [6], [7], [9], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [18], [19], and [20] are not directly relevant to the query as they do not provide a definition or explanation of exons in the context of biology.

[1] and [9] are highly relevant as they directly discuss contour plowing and its effects on reducing soil erosion. They both mention tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope and how it prevents soil erosion.

[10] is relevant as it mentions plowing with furrows up and down slopes can make erosion worse, implying that contour plowing can help reduce erosion.

[18] is somewhat relevant as it discusses conservation tillage systems, which can be used to decrease soil erosion losses. However, it does not specifically mention contour plowing.

[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [19], and [20] are not relevant to the query as they do not discuss contour plowing or its effects on reducing soil erosion.
