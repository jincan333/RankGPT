 original response: To determine the relevance of each passage to the query "define visceral?", I will analyze the content of each passage and assess how well it provides a definition or explanation of the term "visceral." I will then assign a relevance score to each passage, with a higher score indicating a higher level of relevance to the query. Finally, I will sort the passages in descending order based on their relevance scores.

1. This passage provides a detailed explanation of visceral fat and its location in the body. It directly addresses the query and provides relevant information. Relevance score: 18.

3. This passage is identical to passage [2] and provides the same definition of visceral. Relevance score: 15.

4. This passage provides a medical definition of visceral muscle. While it is related to the term "visceral," it does not directly address the query of defining visceral. Relevance score: 10.
