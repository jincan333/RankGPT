 original response: Sure! Here is the step-by-step analysis and ranking of the passages based on their relevance to the query "define visceral?":

[11] Definition of Visceral. Visceral: Referring to the viscera, the internal organs of the body, specifically those within the chest (as the heart or lungs) or abdomen (as the liver, pancreas or intestines). In a figurative sense, something visceral is felt deep down.. It is a gut feeling. [Relevance: This passage directly provides the definition of "visceral" and its association with internal organs.] Relevance score: 10/10

[15] The body of the first visceral motor neuron lies in the CNS, and the body of the second visceral motor neuron lies in an autonomic ganglion (e.g., the sympathetic trunk ganglia). Visceral motor neurons that originate in the CNS are called preganglionic neurons. [Relevance: This passage discusses the anatomy and classification of visceral motor neurons.] Relevance score: 9/10

[6] Visceral pain is the pain, which occurs in the region of the trunk of the body that includes the lungs, heart, abdominal and pelvic organs. Some of the examples of visceral pain consist of: Chronic chest pain, appendicitis, diverticulitis, gallstones and pelvic pain. About 25% of the total population suffers from visceral pain. Visceral pain when compared to somatic pain is harder to pinpoint in regards to its location in the body. [Relevance: This passage defines and provides examples of visceral pain.] Relevance score: 8/10

[12] Heartburn and chest pain are manifestations of visceral pain. Visceral pain by definition means that it originates from the organs of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Visceral pain is distinguished from somatic pain in that it is often diffuse and poorly localized. [Relevance: This passage explains the manifestations and characteristics of visceral pain.] Relevance score: 8/10

[3] Below are some of the dangers you may experience if you have excess visceral fat: 1. Excess visceral fat is associated with different metabolic diseases. 2. Women have a greater risk for breast cancer. 3. Visceral fat recruits a major player in favor of insulin resistance. 4. The excess visceral fat cells act as endocrine cells. [Relevance: This passage discusses the health risks associated with excess visceral fat.] Relevance score: 7/10

[13] Nociceptive pain may also be divided into visceral, deep somatic and superficial somatic pain. Visceral structures are highly sensitive to stretch, ischemia and inflammation, but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain in other structures, such as burning and cutting. [Relevance: This passage explains the classification and sensitivity of visceral pain.] Relevance score: 7/10

[7] All of these are visceral structures that could lose normal mobility and thus be addressed with manipulation. All of these structures could pull on other structures, and thus affect function, in the tensegrity type of model applied within visceral manipulation. Visceral Manipulation Basics. Visceral manipulation is different from many of the reflex systems that attempt to affect organs. The practitioner is not pressing on a distant reflex point, such as a neurolymphatic, hoping to improve lymphatic drainage. [Relevance: This passage discusses the concept of visceral manipulation.] Relevance score: 6/10

[17] Some of the examples of visceral pain consist of: Chronic chest pain, appendicitis, diverticulitis, gallstones and pelvic pain. Know the symptoms and treatment of visceral pain and the difference between deep and superficial or visceral pain. [Relevance: This passage provides examples of visceral pain and mentions the difference between deep and superficial pain.] Relevance score: 6/10

[2] Pericardial Membranes. 1 Fibrous Pericardium-the outer fibrous sac that covers the heart. 2 Parietal Pericardium-lies between the visceral pericardium and the fibrous pericardium. 3 Visceral Pericardium-also called the epicardium, this is the outer layer of the wall of the heart. Parietal Pericardium-lies between the visceral pericardium and the fibrous pericardium. 2 Visceral Pericardium-also called the epicardium, this is the outer layer of the wall of the heart. [Relevance: This passage provides information about the pericardial membranes and the layers of the heart.] Relevance score: 5/10

[14] The visceral pleura is all of the serous membrane that is in direct contact with the lung. The parietal pleura is everything else. The same is true of the pericardium: if it directly touches the heart, it is visceral, but if it only contacts other tissue (including visceral pleura), it is parietal. [Relevance: This passage explains the distinction between visceral and parietal pleura and pericardium.] Relevance score: 5/10

[19] The visceral pleura envelops the lung, and the parietal pleura lines the inner chest wall. There is normally a small quantity (about 3 to 4 teaspoons) of fluid that is spread thinly between the visceral and parietal pleurae. The pleural fluid acts as a lubricant between the two membranes. [Relevance: This passage describes the anatomy and function of the visceral and parietal pleura.] Relevance score: 5/10

[8] There are two types of pleura: visceral pleura covers the lungs, parietal pleura lines the inner surfaces of the walls of the pleural cavity; parietal pleura is sensitive to pain but visceral pleura is not sensitive to pain. [Relevance: This passage explains the types of pleura and their sensitivity to pain.] Relevance score: 4/10

[1] Increased visceral adiposity is a pivotal component of the metabolic syndrome. Differential gene expression patterns of fat-derived peptides (FDPs) in visceral fat and subcutaneous fat have been characterized in the fasting state. Here we examined whether delivery of nutrients differentially affects the expression of FDPs in visceral fat versus subcutaneous fat (in the fed state). [Relevance: This passage discusses the gene expression patterns in visceral fat.] Relevance score: 3/10

[4] Each lung is enclosed by a double-layered serous membrane, called the pleura. The visceral pleura is firmly attached to the surface of the lung. At the hilum, the visceral pleura is continuous with the parietal pleura that lines the wall of the thorax. [Relevance: This passage provides information about the pleura and its attachment to the lung.] Relevance score: 3/10

[9] Serous membranes lining the ventral body cavities actually consist of two separate layers, a visceral layer and a parietal layer. The visceral layer is the component that closely wraps or invests organs in these cavities. The parietal layer lines the walls of the cavity. [Relevance: This passage explains the composition and function of serous membranes.] Relevance score: 3/10

[16] The inner layer, the visceral peritoneum, is wrapped around the visceral organs, located inside the intraperitoneal space for protection. It is thinner than the parietal peritoneum. The mesentery is a double layer of visceral peritoneum that attaches to the gastrointestinal tract. [Relevance

 original response: Sure! Here is the step-by-step analysis and ranking of the passages based on their relevance to the query "define visceral?":

[2] - This passage directly defines the term "visceral" as being felt in or as if in the internal organs of the body. It provides a clear definition of the term. Relevance score: 9/10.

[3] - This passage defines "parietal and visceral peritoneum" and "peritoneal cavity," which are related to the concept of visceral. It provides relevant information about the anatomical terms. Relevance score: 8/10.

[4] - This passage defines and distinguishes between "visceral vs. parietal parts of serous membranes," which is directly related to the concept of visceral. It provides relevant information about the anatomical terms. Relevance score: 8/10.

[5] - This passage discusses the pleural cavity and the relationship between the visceral and parietal pleura. While it doesn't directly define visceral, it provides relevant information about the anatomical structures associated with visceral. Relevance score: 7/10.

[6] - This passage explains that type 2 diabetes can be caused by storing high amounts of visceral fat. It provides relevant information about the health implications of visceral fat. Relevance score: 9/10.
