[1] - Discusses chronic pelvic pain and Pudendal Neuralgia, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 10
[2] - Mentions various causes of pelvic pain, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 14
[3] - Talks about pain along the waistline, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 6
[4] - Same content as [3]. Relevance: 6 (duplicate)
[5] - Discusses causes of pelvic pain in women, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 12
[6] - Focuses on Pelvic inflammatory disease, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 9
[7] - Describes personal experience of right pelvic pain, but doesn't provide causes. Relevance: 4
[8] - Same content as [6]. Relevance: 9 (duplicate)
[9] - Mentions disorders that cause pelvic pain, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 8
[10] - Briefly mentions causes of pelvic pain in women, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 11
[11] - Discusses adhesions and chronic pelvic pain, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 7
[12] - Talks about waist pain, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 5
[13] - Describes personal experience of right pelvic pain, but doesn't provide causes. Relevance: 3
[14] - Mentions Pelvic Inflammatory Disease and lower right abdominal pain, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 13
[15] - Same content as [6] and [8]. Relevance: 9 (duplicate)
[16] - Lists various causes of pelvic pain, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 15
[17] - Discusses chronic pelvic pain and endometriosis, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 2
[18] - Lists numerous causes of pelvic pain, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 16
[19] - Focuses on Pelvic inflammatory disease, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 1
[20] - Discusses Pelvic inflammatory disease, but not specifically right pelvic pain. Relevance: 0

Since [4], [8], and [15] are duplicates, I will exclude them from the ranking and adjust the scores accordingly.
