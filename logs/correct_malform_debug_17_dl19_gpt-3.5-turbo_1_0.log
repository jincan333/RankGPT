 original response: Sure! Here is the ranking of the passages based on their relevance to the query "how are some sharks warm blooded":

[11] - These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures. (Score: 19)

[12] - Mackerel sharks, including great whites, makos, threshers, and porbeagles, have a heat-conserving mechanism known as the rete mirabile (wonderful net), a structure for warming blood passing over the gills. (Score: 18)

[13] - Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warm-blooded (they are endotherms). These sharks can raise their temperature about the temperature of the water; they need to have occasional short bursts of speed in hunting. (Score: 17)

[6] - Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are huge and powerful warm-blooded fish that have been around for at least 11 million years. Also known as white pointers, their ancestors existed on Earth 400 million years ago, which is 200 million years before the first dinosaur appeared. (Score: 16)

[20] - Solved: Mystery of how sharks can smell a drop of blood from a quarter of a mile away. They can smell a drop of blood in the ocean a quarter of a mile away. Now the mystery of exactly how sharks use their astonishing sense of smell to find prey has been solved. Researchers have shown that their noses use 'smell stereo' to detect tiny delays - no more than half a second long - in the time that odors take to reach one nostril compared to the other one.

[14] - The bull shark, also known as the Zambezi shark in Africa, and Lake Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. The bull shark is known for its aggressive nature, predilection for warm shallow water, and presence in brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and rivers. Bull sharks can thrive in both salt and fresh water and can travel far up rivers. They have been known to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois, although few freshwater human-shark interactions have been recorded. (Score: 14)

[10] - The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark or, unofficially, as Zambi in Africa and Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. The bull shark is known for its aggressive nature, predilection for warm shallow water, and presence in brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and rivers. Bull sharks can thrive in both saltwater and freshwater and can travel far up rivers. (Score: 13)

[5] - Bull shark Facts. Bull shark is a type of shark that is best known by its aggressive behavior. This fish can be found in warm, shallow waters of all oceans of the world. (Score: 12)

[9] - Whale Shark. The Whale Shark is the largest and the heaviest living shark because its weight is more than 21 tons and its length is more than 12 meters. It is found in open oceans and warm waters. It feeds on plankton but sometimes it also uses other small fishes as food. It is not facing any serious threat of extinction as they are found in large numbers. (Score: 11)

[3] - Tiger Sharks: Another large shark, capable of growing to a length of over 16 feet, or 5 meters, the Tiger Shark can be found in the Caribbean and other warm waters around the world. (Score: 10)

[2] - The oceanic whitetip shark, Carcharhinus longimanus, is a large pelagic shark of tropical and warm temperate seas. It is a stocky shark, most notable for its long, white-tipped, rounded fins. The Oceanic Whitetip Shark is an Aggressive Predator. (Score: 9)

[15] - The bull shark, also known as the Zambezi shark in Africa, and Lake Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. The bull shark is known for its aggressive nature, predilection for warm shallow water, and presence in brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and rivers. Bull sharks can thrive in both salt and fresh water and can travel far up rivers. They have been known to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois, about 700 miles (1100 km) from the ocean. (Score: 8)

[19] - Smell is probably the most important shark sense, so much so that sharks have been referred to as swimming noses. There are some impressive statistics to back this up, too. A shark can sniff out fish extracts that make up only one part for every 10 billion parts. Other research shows sharks are able to respond to one part blood for every one million parts of water; this is like being able to smell one teaspoon of something in a swimming pool. What's more, sharks can smell these small amounts from hundreds of meters away. (Score: 6)

[4] - How do sharks smell blood in the water? They can't really see in the water. But think of it like this, let's say if you were blindfolded and you were pretending that you were a shark, and you sat a plate of pizza on the table, you can smell that pizza like a shark can smell blood. (Score: 5)

[16] - Bull sharks are the most dangerous sharks in the world, according to many experts. This is because they're an aggressive species of shark, and they tend to hunt in waters where people often swim: along tropical shorelines. Bull sharks live throughout the world, in shallow, warm ocean waters. (Score: 2)

[17] - A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. There are currently two species of mako recognized, the Longfin (Isurus paucus) and the Shortfin (I. oxyrinchus). (Score: 1)

[18] - Many sharks can live for about 20 to 30 years, with some species known to live a fairly longer life. The lifespans of large sharks are greater than that of the smaller sharks. The great white shark reaches its maturity at the age of 15 and has a lifespan

[12] - Let's begin studying the area of a trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid is equal to one half the height multiplied by the sum of the lengths of the bases. It is expressed as. where A is the area of the trapezoid, h is the height, and b1 and b2 are the lengths of the two bases. The bases and height of the trapezoid are required in order to determine its area. Let's work on two exercises that will help us apply this area formula to trapezoids. Exercise 1. Find the area of trapezoid ABCD. Solution: This problem appears to be quite simple because we are given the lengths of both bases and the height of the trapezoid. (Score: 11)

[1] - The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment. (Relevance score: 18)
[2] - The opposite sides of a trapezoid that are parallel to each other are called bases. The remaining sides of the trapezoid, which intersect at some point if extended, are called the legs of the trapezoid. The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment. (Relevance score: 19)

 original response: Sure! Here is the rank of the passages based on their relevance to the search query "axon terminals or synaptic knob definition":

[1] - Axon terminals are that part of a nerve cell that make synaptic connections with another nerve cell or with an effector cell (e.g. muscle cell or gland cell). Axon terminals contain various neurotransmitters and release them at the synapse. (Score: 18)

[3] - Axon terminals (also called synaptic boutons) are distal terminations of the branches of an axon. An axon nerve fiber is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, that conducts electrical impulses (called action potentials) away from the neuron's cell body, or soma, in order to transmit those impulses to other neurons. (Score: 14)

[4] - Upper motor neurons release a neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, from their axon terminal knobs, which are received by nicotinic receptors of the alpha motor neurons. In turn, alpha motor neurons relay the stimulus. From there, acetylcholine is released from the axon terminal knobs of alpha motor neurons and received by postsynaptic receptors (Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) of muscles, thereby relaying the stimulus to contract muscle fibers. (Score: 13)

[9] - Calcium ions trigger a contraction of the muscle cell. Summary. Each skeletal muscle cell is individually stimulated by a motor neuron. The neuromuscular junction is the place where the terminal portion of a motor neuron axon meets a muscle cell membrane, separated by a synaptic cleft. (Score: 12)

[10] - What are the steps in muscle contraction. 1. Efferent motor cortex axons synapse on the spinal cord and generate an action potential in the α-motor neuron. 2. The action potential travels to the axon terminal, releasing acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. 3. Acetylcholine binds a receptor on the skeletal muscle cell and generates an action potential, increasing Ca++ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 4. Ca++ initiates contraction, resulting in shortening of the muscle cell and, consequently, movement. (Score: 11)

[11] - The action potential travels to the axon terminal, releasing acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. 3. Acetylcholine binds a receptor on the skeletal muscle cell and generates an action potential, increasing Ca++ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. (Score: 10)

[14] - Storage of the neurotransmitter in storage granules or vesicles in the axon terminal. 2 Calcium enters the axon terminal during an action potential, causing release of the neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. 3 After its release, the transmitter binds to and activates a receptor in the postsynaptic membrane. (Score: 9)

[18] - Synaptic Transmission. Communication between nerve cells occurs by the propagation of an action potential by one neuron down its axon and into the synaptic terminal where chemical neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters diffuse across the cleft and bind to receptors on target neurons. (Score: 8)

[19] - The neuromuscular junction is the place where the terminal portion of a motor neuron axon meets a muscle cell membrane, separated by a synaptic cleft. An action potential arriving at the axon terminal brings about the release of acetylcholine, which leads to depolarization of the motor end plate. (Score: 7)

[2] - Activity at an axon terminal: Neuron A is transmitting a signal at the axon terminal to neuron B (receiving). Features: 1. Mitochondrion. 2. Synaptic vesicle with neurotransmitters. 3. Autoreceptor. 4. Synapse with neurotransmitter released (serotonin). (Score: 6)

[5] - 1 A chemical that is released into the synaptic cleft from the axon terminal of a sending neuron, crosses a synapse, and binds to appropriate receptor sites on the dendrites or cell body of a receiving neuron, influencing the cell either to fire or not to fire. 2 Receptors. Neurotransmitters. 2 A chemical that is released into the synaptic cleft from the axon terminal of a sending neuron, crosses a synapse, and binds to appropriate receptor sites on the dendrites or cell body of a receiving neuron, influencing the cell either to fire or not to fire. 3 Receptors.

[7] - 1 Reuptake – re-absorption of a neurotransmitter into the neuron. 2 Transporters, or membrane transport proteins, pump neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft back into axon terminals (the presynaptic neuron) where they are stored. Enzyme degradation – special chemicals called enzymes break it down. 2 Reuptake – re-absorption of a neurotransmitter into the neuron. 3 Transporters, or membrane transport proteins, pump neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft back into axon terminals (the presynaptic neuron) where they are stored. (Score: 3)

[8] - Stages in neurotransmission at the synapse. 1 Synthesis of the neurotransmitter. 2 Storage of the neurotransmitter in storage granules or vesicles in the axon terminal. 3 Calcium enters the axon terminal during an action potential, causing release of the neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. (Score: 2)

E) migratory gap. The region between an axon terminal of one neuron and a dendrite of another neuron is called the *. (Score: 1)

[13] - Axons are covered by a membrane known as axolemma; the cytoplasm of axon is called axoplasm. The branched end of an axon is formed by telodendra; the swollen end of a telodendron is known as the axon terminal; which joins the dendron or cell body of another neurone forming a synaptic connection. (Score: 0)

[16] - The axon extends from the cell body to the neuron's terminal ending. Axons lack terminal knobs and have a radius that remains constant throughout their lengths, leading to a relatively smooth appearance. In terms of composition, dendrites have ribosomes but lack myelin, whereas axons have myelin but lack ribosomes. (Score: 16)

[1] Description: In most eukaryotic genes, coding regions (exons) are interrupted by noncoding regions (introns). During transcription, the entire gene is copied into a pre-mRNA, which includes exons and introns. During the process of RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons joined to form a contiguous coding sequence. [Relevance: 9]

[2] These sequences, which help position the splicing apparatus, are found in the exons of genes and bind proteins that help recruit splicing machinery to the correct site. Most splicing occurs between exons on a single RNA transcript, but occasionally occurs, in which exons on different pre-mRNAs are ligated together. [Relevance: 7]

[3] Genes contain exons which are regions coding for proteins and which are interrupted by the unused sequences called introns. Exons have been found to include both sequences coding for amino acids and untranslated sequences. The introns are removed and the exons are joined together to form the final functional mRNA. [Relevance: 10]

[4] Exon. any nucleotide sequence encoded by a gene that remains present within the final mature RNA product of that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing. The term exon refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding... enâ.wikipediaâ.orgâ/wikiâ/Exon. [Relevance: 8]

[5] intron inÂ·tron (Ä­n'trÅn) n. A segment of a gene situated between exons that does not function in coding for protein synthesis. After transcription of a gene to messenger RNA, the transcriptions of introns are removed, and the exons are spliced together by enzymes before translation and assembly of amino acids into proteins. Compare exon. [Relevance: 7]

[8] Exons can be termed as DNA bases which are translated into mRNA. Introns are also DNA bases that are found in between exons. Introns are very much common in the genome of higher vertebrates such as human beings and mice but unlikely to be seen in the genome of certain varieties of eukaryotic micro-organisms. [Relevance: 10]

[9] In the a (I) collagen gene, there are 21 exons which consist of this primordial unit, 9 exons which consist of 2 primordial units, 1 exon of three primordial units, and 10 exons which consist of 1 or 2 primordial units with 9 base pairs deleted (Darnell, p. 907).ince sponges can contain both fibrillar and non-fibrillar collagens, the amplification of this gene family had begun in the early animals (Exposito, 1990). Type IV collagen is known from sponges (Boute, 1997) and vertebrates and invertebrates use collagen IV in their basement membranes. [Relevance: 5]

[10] I would like to look up the total number of exons in a transcript, starting with the NM# for this cDNA. For example, say I have a list of thousands of mutations which are formatted like this: PRAMEF1:NM_023013:exon3:c.T314A:p.L105X How can I tell if this mutation occurs in the last exon of the transcript? [Relevance: 6]

[11] Description: In most eukaryotic genes, coding regions (exons) are interrupted by noncoding regions (introns). During transcription, the entire gene is copied into a pre-mRNA, which includes exons and introns. During the process of RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons joined to form a contiguous coding sequence. This mature mRNA is ready for translation. [Relevance: 9]

[12] Exons are coding areas whereas introns are non-coding areas. An exon is termed as a nucleic acid sequence which is represented in the RNA molecule. Introns, on the other hand, are termed as nucleotide sequences seen within the genes which are removed through RNA splicing for generating a mature RNA molecule. [Relevance: 9]

[13] A genomic library will contain all the exons, introns, and transcriptional factors that are not found in the cDNA library. cDNA library does contain exons, which is the protein coding regions. They contain no introns. [Relevance: 10]

[14] We amplified a 466-bp fragment of KRAS encoding exon 2 and partial intron 2, as well as a 1564-bp fragment of p53 spanning from exon 5 to exon 8, including introns 5, 6, and 7, from both cell lines and DNA isolated from exosomes derived from the same cell lines (Fig. 2A). [Relevance: 4]

[15] Two isozymes are encoded by the PKM gene: PKM1 and PKM2. The M-gene consists of 12 exons and 11 introns. PKM1 and PKM2 are different splicing products of the M-gene (exon 9 for PKM1 and exon 10 for PKM2) and solely differ in 23 amino acids within a 56-amino acid stretch (aa 378-434) at their carboxy terminus.

Biology is the science of life. A more realistic and accurate definition of Biology is the reductionist definition: Biology is the natural science that studies the no-spontaneous transfer of energy and the quasi-stable systems that experience it. Now that we have inferred a realistic definition of life, things will go easier.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technology in molecular biology used to amplify a single copy or a few copies of a piece of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence. If the genomic DNA sequence of a gene is known, RT-PCR can be used to map the location of exons and introns in the gene.

Such stretches of DNA, which get transcribed into RNA but not translated into protein, are called introns. Those stretches of DNA that do code for amino acids in the protein are called exons. Examples: 1 The gene for one type of collagen found in chickens is split into 52 separate exons. 2 The gene for dystrophin, which is mutated in boys with muscular dystrophy, has 79 exons.

EDPAS: Regulation of early embryo development and pluripotency through alternative splicing. In the present study, two SNPs were detected, locating in exon 3 of the Mrf4 gene, and in exon 1 of the MyoD gene. The 5' proximal end of dystrophin is more susceptible to duplication events and the most common exonic duplication mutation in DMD/BMD patients has been shown to involve exon 2.

For other uses, see Exon (disambiguation). An exon is any part of a gene that codes for a part of the final mature RNA product of that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing. The term exon refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts. In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature messenger RNA.

[11] - The Salvation Army was founded in London's East End in 1865 by one-time Methodist minister William Booth and his wife Catherine.
[12] - By the end of the century, the Salvation Army established its posts in several European countries, India, South Africa, and South America. In the 1890s, the Salvation Army had some 45,000 officers in Britain and 10,000 worldwide.
[13] - The earliest recorded emigration occurred as early as 1882 when the Salvation Army participated in the recruitment of women emigrants for Australia. Then, in 1885, a regular series of notices appeared in the Army's magazines advertising emigration to Australia, South Africa, and Canada.
[4] - A competitor paid its workers just two pennies a gross, while The Salvation Army paid their employees twice that amount. The Army also began to be involved in relief work, assisting in times of emergency and disaster. This included the effects of war, with The Salvation Army Naval and Military League starting in 1894.

[4] A competitor paid its workers just two pennies a gross, while The Salvation Army paid their employees twice that amount. The Army also began to be involved in relief work, assisting in times of emergency, and disaster. This included the effects of war, with The Salvation Army Naval and Military League starting in 1894.

[13] The earliest recorded emigration occurred as early as 1882, when the Salvation Army participated in recruitment of women emigrants for Australia. Then, in 1885, a regular series of notices appeared in the Army's magazines advertising emigration to Australia, South Africa, and Canada. (Score: 16)

[2] The Salvation Army has its own crest. The original design was produced by Captain William Ebdon in 1878, and appeared on the Salvation Army letterhead by 1879. It is similar to the crest still in use today. Each part of the crest has a different meaning: The sun in the center represents the light and fire of the Holy Spirit.

The nonprofit Community Rebuilders helps homeless Veterans find safe, affordable housing and the Salvation Army program provides housing, food, and more short-term overnight lodging.

 original response: Sure! Here is the ranking of the passages based on their relevance to the query "when was the salvation army founded":

[11] The Salvation Army was founded in London's East End in 1865 by one-time Methodist minister William Booth and his wife Catherine. Originally, Booth named the organization the East London Christian Mission. (Score: 19)

[12] By the end of the century, the Salvation Army established its posts in several European countries, India, South Africa, and South America. In the 1890s, the Salvation Army had some 45,00 officers in Britain and 10,000 worldwide. (Score: 18)

[4] A competitor paid its workers just two pennies a gross, while The Salvation Army paid their employees twice that amount. The Army also began to be involved in relief work, assisting in times of emergency, and disaster. This included the effects of war, with The Salvation Army Naval and Military League starting in 1894.

[13] The earliest recorded emigration occurred as early as 1882, when the Salvation Army participated in recruitment of women emigrants for Australia. Then, in 1885, a regular series of notices appeared in the Army's magazines advertising emigration to Australia, South Africa, and Canada. (Score: 16)

[2] The Salvation Army has its own crest. The original design was produced by Captain William Ebdon in 1878, and appeared on the Salvation Army letterhead by 1879. It is similar to the crest still in use today. Each part of the crest has a different meaning: The sun in the center represents the light and fire of the Holy Spirit. The letter 'S' behind the cross stands for Salvation. (Score: 15)

The nonprofit Community Rebuilders helps homeless Veterans find safe, affordable housing and the Salvation Army program provides housing, food, and more short-term overnight lodging. By joining forces with VA, the organizations could reach even more Veterans across Michigan who needed housing assistance, such as those living in emergency shelters, in encampments and on the streets.

 original response: Sure! Here is the ranking of the passages based on their relevance to the query "when was the salvation army founded":

[11] The Salvation Army was founded in London's East End in 1865 by one-time Methodist minister William Booth and his wife Catherine. Originally, Booth named the organization the East London Christian Mission. (Score: 19)

[12] By the end of the century, the Salvation Army established its posts in several European countries, India, South Africa, and South America. In the 1890s, the Salvation Army had some 45,00 officers in Britain and 10,000 worldwide. (Score: 18)

[4] A competitor paid its workers just two pennies a gross, while The Salvation Army paid their employees twice that amount. The Army also began to be involved in relief work, assisting in times of emergency, and disaster. This included the effects of war, with The Salvation Army Naval and Military League starting in 1894.

[13] The earliest recorded emigration occurred as early as 1882, when the Salvation Army participated in recruitment of women emigrants for Australia. Then, in 1885, a regular series of notices appeared in the Army's magazines advertising emigration to Australia, South Africa, and Canada. (Score: 16)

[2] The Salvation Army has its own crest. The original design was produced by Captain William Ebdon in 1878, and appeared on the Salvation Army letterhead by 1879. It is similar to the crest still in use today. Each part of the crest has a different meaning: The sun in the center represents the light and fire of the Holy Spirit. The letter 'S' behind the cross stands for Salvation. (Score: 15)

The nonprofit Community Rebuilders helps homeless Veterans find safe, affordable housing and the Salvation Army program provides housing, food, and more short-term overnight lodging. By joining forces with VA, the organizations could reach even more Veterans across Michigan who needed housing assistance, such as those living in emergency shelters, in encampments and on the streets.

[4] A competitor paid its workers just two pennies a gross, while The Salvation Army paid their employees twice that amount. The Army also began to be involved in relief work, assisting in times of emergency, and disaster. This included the effects of war, with The Salvation Army Naval and Military League starting in 1894.

[13] The earliest recorded emigration occurred as early as 1882, when the Salvation Army participated in recruitment of women emigrants for Australia. Then, in 1885, a regular series of notices appeared in the Army's magazines advertising emigration to Australia, South Africa, and Canada. (Score: 16)

[2] The Salvation Army has its own crest. The original design was produced by Captain William Ebdon in 1878, and appeared on the Salvation Army letterhead by 1879. It is similar to the crest still in use today. Each part of the crest has a different meaning: The sun in the center represents the light and fire of the Holy Spirit.

The nonprofit Community Rebuilders helps homeless Veterans find safe, affordable housing and the Salvation Army program provides housing, food, and more short-term overnight lodging.

[4] A competitor paid its workers just two pennies a gross, while The Salvation Army paid their employees twice that amount. The Army also began to be involved in relief work, assisting in times of emergency, and disaster. This included the effects of war, with The Salvation Army Naval and Military League starting in 1894.

[13] The earliest recorded emigration occurred as early as 1882, when the Salvation Army participated in recruitment of women emigrants for Australia. Then, in 1885, a regular series of notices appeared in the Army's magazines advertising emigration to Australia, South Africa, and Canada. (Score: 16)

[2] The Salvation Army has its own crest. The original design was produced by Captain William Ebdon in 1878, and appeared on the Salvation Army letterhead by 1879. It is similar to the crest still in use today. Each part of the crest has a different meaning: The sun in the center represents the light and fire of the Holy Spirit.

The nonprofit Community Rebuilders helps homeless Veterans find safe, affordable housing and the Salvation Army program provides housing, food, and more short-term overnight lodging.

[4] A competitor paid its workers just two pennies a gross, while The Salvation Army paid their employees twice that amount. The Army also began to be involved in relief work, assisting in times of emergency, and disaster. This included the effects of war, with The Salvation Army Naval and Military League starting in 1894.

[13] The earliest recorded emigration occurred as early as 1882, when the Salvation Army participated in recruitment of women emigrants for Australia. Then, in 1885, a regular series of notices appeared in the Army's magazines advertising emigration to Australia, South Africa, and Canada. (Score: 16)

[2] The Salvation Army has its own crest. The original design was produced by Captain William Ebdon in 1878, and appeared on the Salvation Army letterhead by 1879. It is similar to the crest still in use today. Each part of the crest has a different meaning: The sun in the center represents the light and fire of the Holy Spirit.

The nonprofit Community Rebuilders helps homeless Veterans find safe, affordable housing and the Salvation Army program provides housing, food, and more short-term overnight lodging.

[13] The earliest recorded emigration occurred as early as 1882, when the Salvation Army participated in recruitment of women emigrants for Australia. Then, in 1885, a regular series of notices appeared in the Army's magazines advertising emigration to Australia, South Africa, and Canada. (Score: 16)

[2] The Salvation Army has its own crest. The original design was produced by Captain William Ebdon in 1878, and appeared on the Salvation Army letterhead by 1879. It is similar to the crest still in use today. Each part of the crest has a different meaning: The sun in the center represents the light and fire of the Holy Spirit.

White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter.

Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto.

Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round.

In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm).

I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 15)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 12)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 13)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 7)

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles.

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles.

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[5] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. (Relevance score: 11)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[10] Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. (Relevance score: 15)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce trees are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (up to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (up to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[14] Blue spruce. The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 4)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[1] Description: Douglas-fir trees, which are also called red firs, Oregon pines, and Douglas spruce, are neither true fir trees nor pines nor spruces! The scientific genus name Pseudotsuga means "false hemlock," alluding to another kind of tree that Douglas-firs are similar to. Douglas-firs are evergreen trees, meaning that they keep their needle-like leaves year-round. There are two varieties of this species, coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, which are differentiated by their habitats, growth rates, and physical characteristics.

[2] The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. (Relevance score: 12)

[3] The Norway Spruce, a European native, was probably the original Christmas tree. The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description: Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young. (Relevance score: 13)

[4] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname. (Relevance score: 10)

[7] White Spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Description: White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age. (Relevance score: 16)

[8] Product Description: Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On average, it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant, the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted onto. (Relevance score: 9)

[11] The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 7)

[12] (Redirected from Picea pungens). The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. (Relevance score: 6)

[13] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping; however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones, and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm). (Relevance score: 5)

[15] I need help in deciding on Norway Spruce or White Spruce. I plan to plant two rows of evergreen trees to buffer the front yard from the semi-busy road. Because of the deer issue, I seem to be left with spruce trees as the only options. White Spruce comes cheaper by 1/3 than Norway Spruce, other than that, I don't know what's the difference between these two kinds of spruces and would appreciate any input in helping me make the choice.

[3] What is a thigh lift? Thigh lift surgery reshapes the thighs by reducing excess skin and fat, resulting in smoother skin and better-proportioned contours of the thighs and lower body. If fitness and weight control efforts have not achieved your goals for a body that is firmer, more youthful-looking and more proportionate to your overall body image, a surgical lift may be right for you. What thigh lift surgery can't do. Thigh lifts are not intended strictly for the removal of excess fat. Liposuction alone can remove excess fat deposits where skin has good elasticity and is able to naturally conform to new body contours. In cases where skin elasticity is poor, a thigh lift along with liposuction may be recommended. (Relevance Score: 1)

[11] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion. Terrace Farming In terracing, wide steps are cut around the slopes of hills to prevent soil erosion. Contour ploughing follows the “natural shape” of the slope without altering it. Terrace farming alters the shape of the slope to produce flat areas that provide a catchment for water. (Relevance Score: 19)

[13] Conservation tillage systems (described below) can be an important part of a sustainable agricultural system, in that they can be used to decrease soil erosion losses ordinarily associated with typical US agricultural practices. Conservation tillage is basically any system of cultivating that reduces soil or water loss when compared to conventional moldboard plowing, which turns over the soil completely.

[15] Tillage and planting practices that reduce erosion include contour cultivation and strip-cropping. Contour cultivation is cultivation that follows the contours of a field, producing furrows that run perpendicular or at angles to the slope-line of a field. Sheet erosion is caused by raindrops. Sheet erosion is defined as the uniform removal of soil in thin layers from sloping land. This, of course, is nearly impossible; in reality, the loose soil merely runs off with the rain. (Relevance Score: 19)

[16] Conservation tillage can be an economical option for farmers, plus provides a number of potential environmental benefits: 1 Reduced plowing makes cropland much less vulnerable to soil erosion: conservation tillage reduces soil erosion by as much as 90 percent, compared to systems using intensive tillage. (Relevance Score: 19)

[17] Humans can cause erosion by clean cutting trees and brush. Without the root structure to hold the soil in place, it can wash or blow away. Agriculture causes erosion by overgrazing and plowing remove a lower ground cover. Plowing with the furrows up and down slopes can make erosion worse than plowing along the slope.
