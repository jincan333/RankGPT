[17] It is also important to note two types of affixes: inflectional and derivational. Inflectional morphemes can only be a suffix, and they transform the function of a word, such as adding an '-ly' suffix to the base noun of 'friend.' This becomes the word 'friendly,' which has 2 morphemes.The-ly is an inflectional morpheme because it changes the noun into an adjective.erivational morphemes can be either a suffix or a prefix, and they have the ability to transform either the function or the meaning of a word.
