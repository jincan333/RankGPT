Passage [1] is highly relevant as it provides a detailed cost range for concrete floors, including factors that affect the cost.

Passage [2] is relevant as it discusses the cost of applying concrete floor coating, which is related to interior concrete flooring.

Passage [3] is less relevant as it only mentions decorative concrete flooring as an alternative to traditional surfaces without discussing costs.

Passage [4] is not relevant as it focuses on interior drain tiles and basement waterproofing costs, not concrete flooring.

Passage [5] is highly relevant as it provides a basic cost range for pouring and finishing a concrete floor.

Passage [6] is not relevant as it discusses the cost of reinforcing floor supports when adding concrete for radiant heat, not the cost of interior concrete flooring.

Passage [7] is less relevant as it discusses stamped concrete for various applications, but does not specifically mention interior concrete flooring costs.

Passage [8] is relevant as it provides some cost information for concrete floors, although it is not as detailed as other passages.

Passage [9] is relevant as it discusses the cost of acid-stained concrete flooring and commercial-grade epoxy flooring.

Passage [10] is not relevant as it focuses on the cost of building wood basketball floors, not concrete flooring.

Passage [11] is less relevant as it discusses the cost of using color surface hardener for concrete floors, but does not provide overall cost information for interior concrete flooring.

Passage [12] is relevant as it provides cost information for concrete resurfacing overlays suitable for flooring applications.

Passage [13] is not relevant as it only contains tags and does not provide any concrete flooring cost information.

Passage [14] is not relevant as it focuses on the cost of concrete driveways, not interior concrete flooring.

Passage [15] is highly relevant as it provides a basic cost range for pouring and finishing a concrete floor, similar to passage [5].

Passage [16] is less relevant as it discusses epoxy flooring costs, which is related to concrete flooring but not specifically interior concrete flooring.

Passage [17] is relevant as it provides cost information for polished concrete floors.

Passage [18] is relevant as it provides a cost range for concrete floors based on the level of complexity.

Passage [19] is not relevant as it discusses the structural support required for concrete roofs, not interior concrete flooring.

Passage [20] is less relevant as it only briefly mentions the cost of polished concrete floors without providing specific cost information.
