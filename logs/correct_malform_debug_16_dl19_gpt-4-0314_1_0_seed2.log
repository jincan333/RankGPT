 original response: First, let's analyze the relevance of each passage to the query "who is Robert Gray":

[1] and [2] are about Robert Downey Jr. and his father, not relevant to Robert Gray.
[3] is about a horse named Traveller, not relevant to Robert Gray.
[4] mentions a Stephen Gray, but not a Robert Gray.
[5] is relevant as it mentions Captain Robert Gray exploring the mouth of the Columbia River.
[6] is about Freddie Gray, not relevant to Robert Gray.
[7] is about Robert Pattinson, not relevant to Robert Gray.
[8] is about Dorian Gray, a fictional character, not relevant to Robert Gray.
[9] is about Matthew Gray Gubler, not relevant to Robert Gray.
[10] is about a shampoo product, not relevant to Robert Gray.
[11] discusses the name Robert, but not specifically about Robert Gray.
[12] mentions a Robert McReynolds, not relevant to Robert Gray.
[13] is about pearl-gray color, not relevant to Robert Gray.
[14] is about Jackie Gray, not relevant to Robert Gray.
[15] is about the Flash character, not relevant to Robert Gray.
[16] is about Emma Roberts, not relevant to Robert Gray.

[18] is about James Gray, not relevant to Robert Gray.
[19] is about the painting of Dorian Gray, not relevant to Robert Gray.
[20] is about Ken Gray, not relevant to Robert Gray.

Now, let's rate the relevance between the query and each passage from score 0 to 19 with all passages having distinctive scores:

[5] - 19 (most relevant)
[4] - 18 (mentions a Gray, but not Robert Gray)
[11] - 17 (discusses the name Robert, but not specifically about Robert Gray)

The rest of the passages are not relevant to the query, so we will assign them scores from 16 to 0 in the order they were provided:

[1] - 16

[13] This passage is a duplicate of passage [1]. Relevance: 19

[14] This passage explains that Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. Relevance: 9

[15] This passage mentions that Legionella pneumophila causes legionellosis, including a pneumonia-type illness called Legionnaires' disease. Relevance: 8

[16] This passage discusses Legionnaires' disease, a form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria, and mentions that the most common strains associated with human disease are pneumophila and longbeachae. Relevance: 7

[17] This passage is very similar to passage [16], discussing Legionnaires' disease and the strains of Legionella bacteria that cause disease in humans, including pneumophila. Relevance: 6

[18] This passage directly states that Legionnaires' disease is the pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. Relevance: 5

[19] This passage is a duplicate of passage [18]. Relevance: 5

[20] This passage lists different types of pneumonia, including Legionnaires' disease, which is caused by Legionella pneumophila. Relevance: 4

Since passages [1], [6], [10], and [13] are duplicates, I will only include [1] in the ranking. Similarly, passages [18] and [19] are duplicates, so I will only include [18] in the ranking.

 original response: [Start]

Passage [6] and [11] are the most relevant to the search query as they directly mention the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the involvement of Soviet republics and Mikhail Gorbachev. 

Passage [9], [12], and [13] are somewhat relevant as they mention the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and its relation to the USSR, but they do not directly address the formation or who was involved in the formation.

Passage [14] is slightly relevant as it discusses the integration of countries within the CIS framework and its coordinating institutions, but it does not directly address the formation or who was involved in the formation.

Passages [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [10], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], and [20] are not relevant to the search query as they discuss other forms of commonwealths, independent states, or unrelated topics.

Based on the relevance to the search query, the ranking is as follows:

[11] > [6] > [9] > [12] > [13] > [14] > [3] > [2] > [1] > [4] > [7] > [8] > [10] > [15] > [16] > [17] > [18] > [19] > [20] > [5]
