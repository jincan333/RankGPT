 original response: Sure! Here is the step-by-step process to rank the passages based on their relevance to the query "what can contour plowing reduce":

Step 1: Rate the relevance between the query and each document:

[1] - Score: 9 - This passage directly explains that contour plowing reduces the formation of rills and gullies, which are major causes of soil erosion.
[2] - Score: 8 - This passage provides a detailed explanation of how contour plowing helps reduce runoff of water and prevent soil erosion.
[3] - Score: 2 - This passage is not directly related to the query as it only provides definitions and translations of the term "contour plowing."
[4] - Score: 7 - This passage mentions that contour plowing reduces soil erosion and facilitates rainfall infiltration, but also states that terraces are more effective in minimizing soil erosion.
[5] - Score: 1 - This passage is not relevant to the query as it only provides definitions and translations of the term "contour plowing."
[6] - Score: 6 - This passage mentions contour plowing as a method to reduce soil erosion among other options.
[7] - Score: 3 - This passage is a repetition of the definition of contour plowing and does not provide additional relevant information.
[8] - Score: 9 - This passage explains how contour plowing reduces the formation of rills and gullies, which are major causes of topsoil loss and soil erosion.
[9] - Score: 9 - This passage provides a similar explanation to passages [1] and [8] about how contour plowing reduces soil erosion.
[10] - Score: 8 - This passage provides a definition of contour plowing and its practice of plowing across a slope to minimize soil erosion.

[12] - Score: 8 - This passage compares contour plowing and terrace farming as methods to reduce soil erosion on sloping hills.
[13] - Score: 8 - This passage explains how contour plowing prevents fertile topsoil from being carried downhill by flowing rainwater.
[14] - Score: 9 - This passage explains how contour plowing conserves soil by creating ridges that form a water break and prevent soil erosion.
[15] - Score: 7 - This passage mentions contour plowing as a practice for sustainable soil management along with other techniques.
[16] - Score: 8 - This passage provides a definition of contour plowing and mentions its practice in Pennsylvania and Catalonia.
[17] - Score: 9 - This passage explains how contour plowing forms rows that slow water runoff, preventing soil erosion and allowing water to settle into the soil.
[18] - Score: 10 - This passage provides a definition of contour plowing and mentions its practice of plowing and/or planting across a slope to reduce soil erosion.
[19] - Score: 7 - This passage compares contour plowing and terracing as farming techniques to reduce soil erosion.
[20] - Score: 8 - This passage explains the difference between contour plowing and terrace farming in terms of their impact on the shape of the slope and soil erosion prevention.
