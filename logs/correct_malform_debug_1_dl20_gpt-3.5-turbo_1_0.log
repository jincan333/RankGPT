 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention naturalization records. Based on that, we can create an initial ranking. Here are the passages that mention naturalization records:

[8] Public Marriage License. A public marriage license is a public record, and anyone can request a copy or information from the record. This license can be used anywhere in the State of California. Confidential Marriage License A confidential marriage license becomes a confidential record, and the only people able to obtain information about it are the couple, except by special court order.

[20] INFORMATION: Birth records have been maintained in the California Department of Public Health Vital Records since July 1, 1905. The name required on Vital Records (see Items 1C, 6C, 7C, 9C, and 12C) is the name given at birth, or a name received through adoption, court ‐ ordered name change, or naturalization. AKAs (Also Known As) and assumed names cannot be entered as the legal name on the birth record. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. ONLY individuals who are authorized by Health and Safety Code Section 103526 can obtain a Certified Copy of a birth record to establish identity of the registrant (person listed on the certificate).

Based on this information, the initial ranking is as follows:

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most directly related to the query "how long does it take to remove wisdom tooth." Based on the query, the following passages seem to be the most relevant:

[14] - "How long will it take? Of course, every case is different, some taking longer than others. Recognizing that often all 4 wisdom teeth are removed in one visit, it will usually take less than 1 hour for treatment to be completed. Do I have to remove all 4 wisdom teeth at one time? No."

Here is the revised list of passages:

Based on the query, the following passages are most relevant:

[1] Pregnancy Test and Procedures for Detecting Miscarriages. Sometimes, you may receive a positive pregnancy test even after a miscarriage. This can be quite confusing. So, you first need to understand how a pregnancy test is done. What are the causes of a miscarriage and what are the symptoms of a miscarriage are two of the most common questions regarding miscarriages. When you are pregnant, the level of a hormone called hCG,.

[2] Many of us who experience miscarriage are not aware that it is fairly common. For every 10 pregnancies, 1 to 2 end in miscarriage. Miscarriage is most likely to happen early in pregnancy â in fact, 8 out of 10 miscarriages happen in the first three months of pregnancy.

[5] This type of miscarriage usually causes a slight, dark-brown blood loss and the sudden end of normal pregnancy symptoms. It is sometimes called a blighted ovum. Miscarriage later in pregnancy Four-fifths of miscarriages occur in the first 12 weeks (first trimester) of pregnancy.

[8] Early contractions. You can experience contractions even in the first trimester as your body adjusts to the pregnancy. The stretching of the ligaments around the uterus can cause contractions, as can dehydration, constipation and gas pains. If they're accompanied by spotting, bleeding and/or abdominal pain, you need to see a doc to rule out an ectopic pregnancy or a potential miscarriage.

[12] The ligaments that support the uterus will stretch and with this stretching may cause mild cramps. 3. Miscarriage-Cramping during early pregnancy, especially accompanied by spotting or bleeding, is a warning sign of a possible miscarriage.

Based on the query, the following passages are relevant:
[2] A drug's effects on the fetus depend on many things: how much, how often, and when during pregnancy it is used. The early stage of pregnancy is the time when main body parts of the fetus form. Using drugs during this time in pregnancy can cause birth defects and miscarriage.
[8] 1 Prevent early miscarriage. Progesterone deficiency is not the cause of every miscarriage, but scientific research indicates that adequate amounts of progesterone are needed to support the early stages of pregnancy. Progesterone levels naturally increase during each menstrual cycle once ovulation has occurred.

[1] Types of Miscarriage âA miscarriage can take hours, days or even weeks to unfold. The following are examples of types of miscarriage you may experience.â Very Early Miscarriage. Very early miscarriage, which is common â guessed at as up to 50% of all miscarriages â is a pregnancy that ends soon after implantation, sometimes only a few days later.
[2] Whether or not the embryo progresses to developing a successful pregnancy and ultimately a normal and healthy baby is based on the pregnancy alone. Miscarriage is a more common occurrence than people think. We know that up to 50% of pregnancies can end in a miscarriage, many of which are chemical pregnancies. In most cases of early miscarriage, the reason is because of an abnormal embryo, meaning the embryo had some sort of genetic abnormality.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly address the query "can fever cause miscarriage early pregnancy." Based on the query, the following passages are most relevant:

[1] 1 A temperature above 103F (39.50C) during early weeks of pregnancy (usually the first trimester) may be responsible for a miscarriage, spinal cord or mental defects in the baby. Fever in early pregnancy may cause more harm than fever in late pregnancy.

[3] A variety of factors during early pregnancy can cause bleeding. Pink bleeding can be caused by implantation bleeding. Infections, an impending miscarriage, or an ectopic pregnancy can also cause other types of bleeding. Heavy bleeding in early pregnancy requires immediate medical attention, as it may be an indication of a miscarriage.

[9] If you have had more than one miscarriages during your first 12 weeks of pregnancy or one pregnancy loss between 12 and twenty weeks, you need to be worked up by your doctor to find the cause. There are certain conditions that can be treated early on to reduce the chance of miscarriage.

[1] Each state as a tax system which collects money, generally, from residents of that state based on their earned income. This money is then used by the state government to fund state and local programs. Most states collect an income tax, just as the IRS does for the federal government. These states generally collect income tax from both full-and part-time residents of the state, as well as non-residents who collected income from an employee within the state. Each state has its own set of tax forms to be used in these various situations. While most states have an income tax, several do not. Most of these states make up for the lack of income tax collections through their sales tax (although Alaska does not have income tax or sales tax).

[4] No. Taxes withheld by Mississippi casinos as a result of gambling winnings are not refundable in Mississippi. Mississippi residents are not required to report Mississippi gambling winnings as income on their state return.

[8] The amount withheld is non-refundable to the taxpayer. Section 27-7-901 of the Mississippi Code provides that the amount of winnings reported on W2G, 1099 or other informational return from Mississippi casinos are not included in Mississippi income and no income tax credit is allowed for the amount of withholding.

Richard Dawson was the original host when the show debuted on ABC. The original version began in 1976, with a concurrent syndication run starting up a year later; both ended in 1985 within a month of each other.
[12] In 1975, during his tenure as one of Match Game's regular panellists, Dawson was hired by Goodson to host an upcoming project titled Family Feud, which debuted on 12 July 1976 on ABC's daytime schedule. Family Feud was a break-out hit, eventually surpassing the ratings of Match Game in late 1977.

[2] Acetyl-L-carnitine is an amino acid (a building block for proteins) that is naturally produced in the body. It helps the body produce energy.

[3] But before I get into the details of this flawed study, let's first take a closer look at carnitine and what it does in your body. The Transporter. L-carnitine, or just carnitine (the L refers to the configuration of the carnitine molecule that is biologically active) is often referred to as an amino acid, but it is not a true amino acid. Carnitine is an amino acid-like compound that is made in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine.

[4] Acetyl L Carnitine is one of the more common formulations of L-Carnitine, which is itself an amino acid that is produced from two other amino acids (Lysine and Methionine). This version, or form, of L-Carnitine is significantly more active than its parent compound due to a higher degree of bioavailability.

[5] L-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Learn how your chances of success can increase with this in your arsenal.

[11] Lysine is an essential amino acid, which means that it is needed by the body. However, this amino acid cannot be synthesized naturally. It needs to come from a source, and that source is the food that we eat. Primarily lysine is needed to ensure that the bones grow properly. Aside from being one of the building blocks of protein, Lysine is also essential in the synthesis of Carnitine.

[12] Lysine is one of the amino acids, known as the building blocks of proteins. Because the body can't manufacture lysine, it's considered an essential amino acid and must be acquired through diet. Lysine plays a role in growth, as well as the production of carnitine, which turns fats into energy and helps lower cholesterol.

[14] Carnitine biosynthesis and metabolism. Carnitine, a branched non-essential amino acid, is synthesized from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine.

[17] Lysine, or L-lysine, is an essential amino acid, meaning it is necessary for human health, but the body cannot make it. You have to get lysine from food or supplements. Amino acids like lysine are the building blocks of protein. Lysine is important for proper growth, and it plays an essential role in the production of carnitine, a nutrient responsible for converting fatty acids into energy and helping lower cholesterol.

Now, let's rank the passages:

[Start] [2] > [3] > [4] > [5] > [11] > [12] > [14] > [17] [End]

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention the type of tissue present in bronchioles. Based on that, we can create an initial ranking. Here are the passages that mention the tissue type:

[11] Terminal bronchioles are lined with simple cuboidal epithelium containing club cells.
[12] Terminal bronchioles contain a limited number of ciliated cells and no goblet cells.
[13] Clara cells help the terminal bronchiole to remain open as air passes through it. They release a type of substance known as a surfactant.
[14] Clara cells are nonciliated, and they secrete surfactant, like the type II alveolar epithelial cells found deeper in the bronchial tree.

Now, let's rank these passages:

[Start] [11] > [12] > [13] > [14] [End]

 original response: Sure! Let's start by eliminating any duplicate passages to avoid redundancy. Here are the unique passages:

[1] Call it the H&M effect. Today's brides are expecting high-design wedding dresses for a fraction of the cost of a designer dress. According to the Knot's 2009 Real Weddings Survey, the average price paid for a wedding dress in 2009 was $1,134, a drop from the 2007 high when women spent $1,317 on average for a wedding dress.
[2] Questions: wedding cost statistics? what is the average cost of a wedding? what is the average price of a wedding dress? wedding package prices? how much does the average bride's parents spend on a wedding?
[3] I think roughly 5-10% of the cost of the wedding. So if you're spending $20,000 total, then the dress should cost $1000-$2000 range. For me, my budget for dress, shoes, jewelry, veil, + alterations is $2000 and I'm okay with that.. I'll be wearing it 3 times! (wedding in mexico, ttd photo shoot the next day, and an at home reception).
[4] It really depends on the dress and where you're located. All vendors in different areas charge different rates. In the DC area to alter a simple gown will be average $500 ... if the gown is more complex, then the alterations are more expensive.
[5] 1 And on the high end, expect to pay $2,000 to $5,000 and up for a custom-made designer dress in silk, sometimes with elaborate embellishments of hand-stitched lace or beading, from an upscale wedding boutique. 2 The average cost for a wedding dress is $1,505, according to The Bridal Association of America.
[6] Common Wedding Gown Alterations and Cost: 1 The hem (the bottom) $140-$225. 2 The bottom of your bridal gown will almost always need to be shortened. 3 As such the hem is many times much more complicated than it looks. 4 You may see some plastic webbing around the bottom, or feel it in the dress. Cups are one of those things that almost all brides want in their wedding dresses, but rarely think about before their bridal alterations appointment. 2 The cost to put cups in will vary slightly but you can pretty much expect to pay in the $20-$40 range.
[7] finzup 5 years. I think roughly 5-10% of the cost of the wedding. So if you're spending $20,000 total, then the dress should cost $1000-$2000 range. For me, my budget for dress, shoes, jewelry, veil, + alterations is $2000 and I'm okay with that.. I'll be wearing it 3 times! (wedding in mexico, ttd photo shoot the next day, and an at home reception).
[8] Whoa, the average wedding costs $31,213 and brides are wearing dresses they'll hopefully only wear once that cost, on average, $1,357. These details come from The Knot's survey of nearly 16,000 brides and grooms who got married in 2014.
[9] 1 Wedding dress alterations can run anywhere from $50-$300 depending on the amount of work needed. 2 If you choose a dress that is meant to be full below the waist, an extra piece can be purchased to add to the body of the dress. 3 This piece can cost $30-$100. Websites such as DressFinder.com can aid you in the search for a personal dress designer. 2 According to a forum thread on the website WeddingBee.com, users claimed that wedding dress prices ranged anywhere from $200 to as much as $2,600 for their dress.
[10] Whoa, the average wedding costs $31,213 and brides are wearing dresses they'll hopefully only wear once that cost, on average, $1,357. These details come from The Knot's survey of nearly 16,000 brides and grooms who got married in 2014.
[11] Common Wedding Gown Alterations and Cost: 1 The hem (the bottom) $140-$225 The bottom of your bridal gown will almost always need to be shortened. As such the hem is many times much more complicated than it looks. 2 The sides $50-$200 Many times brides need the wedding dress taken in at the sides.
[12] The cups (if you aren't wearing a bra) - $20-$40. 2 Cups are one of those things that almost all brides want in their wedding dresses, but rarely think about before their bridal alterations appointment. 3 The cost to put cups in will vary slightly but you can pretty much expect to pay in the $20-$40 range.
[13] Do not forget to factor in the cost of alterations, which can run from $20 for a small nip or tuck in the bodice to $200 or more for more labor-intensive work. 2 If you buy your dress at a bridal salon, ask whether alterations are included and, if not, get a written estimate of the alteration costs ahead of time. In the mid-range, expect to pay $500 to $1,000 for an off-the-rack or custom-made wedding dress, with a small to medium amount of beading or lace detail, from a chain bridal retailer or bridal boutique.
[14] A bodice can be altered from $20 to $150. 2 If you want to have a wedding dress completely redesigned or even have additional materials added to it, the price of this type of job could cost anywhere from $250 to as much as $600 depending on the type of material as well as the complexity of the wedding dress design.
[15] Common Wedding Gown Alterations and Cost: 1 The hem (the bottom) $140-$225 The bottom of your bridal gown will almost always need to be shortened. As such the hem is many times much more complicated than it looks. 2 The sides $50-$200 Many times brides need the wedding dress taken in at the sides.
[16] A bodice alteration can cost $30 for a simple dress to $100 or more for a dress with boning or beading that needs to be removed, then reinserted or reapplied. 2 A hem might run $80 for a simple dress to $200 or more for a multi-layered dress. The three alterations most likely to be done are hemming, bodice alterations, and shortening of sleeves. 2 A bodice alteration can cost $30 for a simple dress to $100 or more for a dress with boning or beading that needs to be removed, then reinserted or reapplied.
[17] Altering the hem (bottom) of the wedding dress: £75 - £100. If your wedding dress is too long for you, you would need to have it shortened to avoid tripping on your wedding dress. The more layers your wedding dress comprises, the more layers that would need to be shortened.
[18] Styles can increase the cost based on the number of layers in the bridal dress, the fabric, and the bottom finishing, such as beads. Bodice: Bodice alterations on wedding gowns are normally done on the side seams. Simple bodice alterations will range in price from $40 to $80.
[19] Repeat after us: Fit is everything. Which is why when it comes to your wedding dress, alterations are also everything. You can splurge on a pricey dress, but if it's not altered properly it won't look any better than a gown that's a tenth

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention the metal used in hip replacements. Based on the query, the following passages are relevant:

[5] - With hip replacement, an acetabular cup usually includes a metal shell and a plastic, metal, or ceramic liner to replace the acetabulum. The femoral stem is inserted inside the femur, and the femoral head (or ball) fits inside the acetabulum. Once the three components are aligned, more natural movement may be restored.

[11] - Three different case studies of cobalt toxicity after hip replacement surgery were presented within 10 days of each other in early 2014. The remarkable nature of these case studies is that "hip pain was not a prominent feature," Dr. Bunning says. The patients did present with similar symptoms, and all were found to have excessively high serum cobalt levels. Two of the cases involved metal-on-polyethylene implants, and one involved a metal-on-metal implant.

Now, let's rank these passages.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly mention the metal used in hip replacements. Based on that, we can create a preliminary ranking. Here are the passages that mention the metal used in hip replacements:

[3] During hip replacement, a surgeon removes the damaged sections of your hip joint and replaces them with parts usually constructed of metal, ceramic and very hard plastic. This artificial joint (prosthesis) helps reduce pain and improve function.

[4] With hip replacement, an acetabular cup usually includes a metal shell and a plastic, metal, or ceramic liner to replace the acetabulum. The femoral stem is inserted inside the femur, and the femoral head (or ball) fits inside the acetabulum.

[6] (Left) In the x-ray of a hip resurfacing taken from the front, a metal cap now covers the femoral head, and a small stem is seen in the femoral neck. A metal socket is also in place. Unlike the traditional total hip replacement shown on the right, the femoral head and neck are not removed.

[11] With hip replacement, an acetabular cup usually includes a metal shell and a plastic, metal, or ceramic liner to replace the acetabulum. The femoral stem is inserted inside the femur, and the femoral head (or ball) fits inside the acetabulum. Once the three components are aligned, more natural movement may be restored.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance to the query:

[Start] [3] > [4] > [6] > [11] [End]

Please note that this is a preliminary ranking based on the direct mention of the metal used in hip replacements. We will refine the ranking further in the next step.

[1] Hip hemiarthroplasty; Hip hemiarthroplasty What is a Hip hemiarthroplasty? A hip hemiarthroplasty is similar to a hip replacement but only one half of the hip joint is replaced. In a hip hemiarthroplasty the top of the thigh bone (femur) is replaced by a metal implant. The hip joint is a ball and socket joint. The socket is formed by a cup in the pelvis, known as the acetabulum.

[2] What is a Hip hemiarthroplasty? A hip hemiarthroplasty is similar to a hip replacement but only one half of the hip joint is replaced. In a hip hemiarthroplasty the top of the thigh bone (femur) is replaced by a metal implant. The hip joint is a ball and socket joint. The socket is formed by a cup in the pelvis, known as the acetabulum.

[11] The implant for a total hip replacement is composed of 3 parts: the stem, the ball, and the socket. The stem is made out of metal, usually cobalt-chrome or titanium, and is placed within the native thighbone. The ball is usually made out of polished metal or ceramic, and fits on top of the stem.

[12] The same materials are used for hip implants—the stem portions of most hip implants are made of metal alloys, the ball portions are made from metal alloys or polished ceramic, and the acetabular sockets are made from metal, polyethylene (plastic), a combination of polyethylene backed by metal, or ceramic.

[13] In a total hip replacement surgery, doctors replace the diseased or damaged hip with an implant consisting of a stem, ball, liner, and socket. 1 The stem, made of metal, is inserted into the femur (thigh bone) and anchors the implant in place. 2 The ball is attached to the top of the stem.

[14] With hip replacement, an acetabular cup usually includes a metal shell and a plastic, metal, or ceramic liner to replace the acetabulum. The femoral stem is inserted inside the femur, and the femoral head (or ball) fits inside the acetabulum.

[15] With hip replacement, an acetabular cup usually includes a metal shell and a plastic, metal, or ceramic liner to replace the acetabulum. The femoral stem is inserted inside the femur, and the femoral head (or ball) fits inside the acetabulum. Once the three components are aligned, more natural movement may be restored.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly answer the query "what metal are hip replacements made of." Based on the query, the following passages are most relevant:

[1] The Many Different Materials Used in Hip Replacement Devices. Hip replacement devices break into a few big categories: Metal on Metal (MOM) â These are what they sound like. Both the socket and the ball are made of stainless steel, titanium, chromium, cobalt or some combination of these.

[2] Hip replacements are among the most common orthopedic procedures. When a hip replacement is performed, the arthritic, damaged hip joint is removed. The ball-and-socket hip joint is then replaced with an artificial implant. Hare are brief descriptions of some of the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Not all implants are options for all patients. A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.

[8] Metal and Plastic Implants. A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.

[10] A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.

First, let's identify the passages that directly define or explain the concept of a Pareto chart in statistics. Based on that, we can rank them accordingly. 

[1] Part Two: Create Your Pareto Chart in Excel. 1 Highlight your data (from B2 to D8 in this example). 2 Quick Tip: Press ALT and F1 on your keyboard to automatically create a chart from the data. Right click in the Chart Area and select Select Data.
[10] The purpose of the Pareto chart is to highlight the most important among a (typically large) set of factors. In quality control, it often represents the most common sources of defects, the highest occurring type of defect, or the most frequent reasons for customer complaints, and so on.
[13] Cause Analysis Tools. Use these tools when you want to conduct root cause analysis for a problem or situation. Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram: identifies many possible causes for an effect or problem and sorts ideas into useful categories. Pareto chart: shows on a bar graph which factors are more significant.
[15] A histogram or Pareto (sorted histogram) is a column chart that shows frequency data. Hereâs a typical example: To create a histogram in Excel, you use the Histogram tool of the Analysis ToolPak.ake sure you load the Analysis ToolPak to add the Data Analysis command to the Data tab. Then youâll be ready to create a histogram. Hereâs how: On a worksheet, type the input data in one column, adding a label in the first cell if you want. Be sure to use quantitative numeric data, like item amounts or test scores.

[Start] [10] > [15] > [13] > [1] [End]

Based on their relevance to the query, the passages are ranked as follows:

 original response: Sure! Let's start the ranking process step by step. 

First, let's identify the passages that directly define or explain the concept of a Pareto chart in statistics. Based on that, we can create a preliminary ranking. Here are the passages that directly define or explain the concept:

[1] Creating a Pareto Chart in Excel. The Pareto Principle, named for Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, suggests that 80% of problems can be traced to as few as 20% of root causes. This can be valuable, even vital information when you are trying to figure out which of many problems to tackle first, or in a complicated troubleshooting environment.

[3] A histogram is a bar graph that illustrates the frequency of an event occurring using the height of the bar as an indicator. A Pareto chart is a special type of histogram that represents the Pareto philosophy (the 80/20 rule) through displaying the events by order of impact.

[6] Pareto Analysis is a statistical technique in decision-making used for the selection of a limited number of tasks that produce significant overall effect. It uses the Pareto Principle (also known as the 80/20 rule) the idea that by doing 20% of the work you can generate 80% of the benefit of doing the entire job.

[11] The purpose of the Pareto chart is to highlight the most important among a (typically large) set of factors. In quality control, it often represents the most common sources of defects, the highest occurring type of defect, or the most frequent reasons for customer complaints, and so on.

[15] For the optimal allocation of resources, see Pareto efficiency. The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance to the search query. 

[Start] [1] > [3] > [6] > [11] > [15] [End]

Please note that this is a preliminary ranking based on the passages that directly define or explain the concept of a Pareto chart in statistics. We will continue refining the ranking in the next steps.

[12] What does the word part ''chron-'' mean? It is from the Greek word for time. A chronometer is something which measures time (chron=time, meter=measure), in other words a clock. The spelling chron as opposed to crâ¦ohn means this word has nothing to do with Crohns disease which was named after Dr. Burrill Crohn. 9 people found this useful.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the query "what is a statutory deed." Based on the content of the passages, the following passages are likely to be the most relevant:

[3] A statutory warranty deed is a warranty deed that references a particular state statute so that you do not have to put the specific warranty language in the deed. Actually, however, when contributing property to a revocable living trust, one does not use any of these. Rather, a Quit Claim Deed is typically used to transfer the property for this type transaction. I hope this has given you the guidance you were seeking. I wish you the best of luck!

[6] Definition of Statutory Warranty Deed. A warranty deed is a document that transfers the title to a property from the seller to the buyer. It protects the buyer from the chance that someone will come along and lay claim to the property by saying the seller had no right to sell it.

[10] The second common requirement for both warranty and quitclaim deeds is that the deed must contain operative words of conveyance showing intent to transfer present title. As previously discussed, the words conveys and warrants are statutory words of conveyance that include covenants of warranty. 765 ILCS 5/8, 5/9.

[11] In Washington when a grantor ( seller ) delivers a statutory warranty deed , the grantor warrants â ( 1 ) That at the time of the making and delivery of such deed he was lawfully seized of an indefeasible estate in fee simple , in and to the premises therein described , and had good right and full power to convey the same ; ( 2 ) that the same were ...

[1] How Did Rock & Roll Music Begin? Rock & roll music began in the 1950s. It was a fusion of different musical styles from across America--blues, gospel, jazz, rhythm & blues, country and swing. The social and economic changes that took place in America during and just after the Second World War contributed to its birth.

[4] It's beginnings. Rock and Roll music did not exist all until the. 1950's. Much of the music that existed before was 'Classical', Folk, Jazz, Blues or Big Band. Rock'n' Roll was crucial to the emergence of teenagers as a social group.

[7] Rock 'n' roll is the archetypal American music, but it didn't emerge in a vacuum. Rock 'n' roll was the product of earlier American musical forms. Rock represents the point where white and black music blended together. The early pioneers of rock 'n' roll were influenced by blues, rhythm-and-blues and country, as well as other types of music. Blues was a major influence on Elvis Presley, and country music had a profound impact on Chuck Berry.

[11] Rock 'n' roll originated from the evolution of rhythm and blues. The term rock and roll was coined by Alan Fried, a Cleveland, Ohio USA disc jockey. Although difficult to nail down to an exact year, it is safe to say that rock and roll began in the mid fifties in the United States.

[3] This means longer, hotter days during the summer. This explains why the dog days of summer are from late January to early March in the Southern Hemisphere. The actual dates of the dog days of summer will vary by location, depending upon latitude and climate.

[12] This means that the moon rises later and later each successive day, sometimes rising in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon, and sometimes at night. Similarly, the moon sets later each day, and can set at any time of the day or night, depending on where it is with respect to the sun. At a rate of 12 degrees per day, the moon completes a full circle, with respect to the sun, about once every 30 days (actually 29.5).

[19] On eBay, there is a vast inventory of outdoor dog houses so that you can find one that fits your dog's needs. During the summer, an igloo dog house gives your dog a shady, cool place that keeps him dry during any afternoon storms. Giving your dog his own home is a great way to keep him happy and comfortable as he enjoys the fresh outdoor air.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the query "define Etruscans." Based on the content of the passages, the following passages are likely to be the most relevant:

[1] Etruscan Legacy. For half a millennium or more, the Etruscans were Europeâs most advanced civilization outside Greece. Made wealthy by international trade, they spent their time making wine, building roads, draining marshes, painting vases, founding cities, creating sculptures, and constructing aqueducts.

[2] About the same time as the Etruscans, a lot of Greeks also came to make Greek colonies. At first, they were probably mainly trading posts, but later Greek people settled down there and began farming. The Greeks settled in southern Italy, where they took over most of the Etruscan land there.

[3] Etruscan civilization was a strong influence on other cultural developments throughout Antiquity, notably on early Celtic culture, such as the Hallstatt style and La Tene Style of Celtic art. Sadly, from 396 BCE onwards, the Etruscan city-states were overcome by Rome and absorbed into the Roman Empire.

[9] To know the history of pasta, read on... The origin of pasta can be traced to the ancient Etruscan civilization. Etruscan is the English word for the people from Corsica and Italy. It is also said that pasta was brought to Italy by explorer and trader Marco Polo. However, the origins of pasta are said to be found in history before his time.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order:

[Start] [1] > [2] > [3] > [9] [End]

[4] Etruscan Etruria. The ancient people of Etruria are labeled Etruscans, and their complex culture was centered on numerous city-states that rose during the Villanovan period in the ninth century BCE and were very powerful during the Orientalizing Archaic periods.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by eliminating any passages that are not directly related to the query "what is mamey." Based on that, we can exclude passages [2], [7], [12], [15], [17], and [20] as they mention mamey in a different context or in relation to other topics. Here is the updated list of passages:

[1] What is a Mamey Tree? Growing mamey fruit trees are indigenous to areas of the Caribbean, West Indies, Central America and Northern South America. Mamey tree planting for the purposes of cultivation does occur, but is rare. The tree is more commonly found in garden landscapes.

[3] Mamey Sapote. Mamey Sapote (Pouteria sapota) (simply Mamey to beloved fans) is a meaty fruit with a brown skin, orange flesh, and large black pit. Mamey is believed to be an antiseptic, and is also eaten to help calm an upset stomach.

[4] You are here. Mamey sapote. Mamey sapote growing tree of the genus Pouteria and also known as Pouteria sapota, Mamey sapote perennial evergreen to semi-deciduous plant also used as ornamental plant, grow in tropic mediterranean or subtropical climate. Leaves obovate green shiny, small white flowers growing next to the branches.

[5] Another possibility for the definition of a mamey is a different type of fruit known as Mammea American, or simply mamey. This fruit differs as it is generally larger, more round, and found on taller trees than the sapote version of the fruit.

[6] Mamey, known sometimes as mamey sapote or just sapote, is a type of tropical fruit native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is cultivated in tropical regions in the Americas including Southern Florida, and is very popular among many Caribbean and Central American peoples.

[8] Pouteria sapota, mamey sapote, is a species of tree native to Middle America, naturally ranging from southern Mexico to southern Costa Rica, plus Cuba.

[9] Pantin Mamey Sapote. Pouteria sapota. A unique, tropical tree fruit with an interior texture that is both creamy and sweet, the vibrant salmon-colored flesh of the âPantinâ mamey sapote is unlike anything most people have ever tasted. The flavor is a combination of sweet potato and pumpkin with undertones of almond, chocolate, honey, and vanilla.

[10] I put my Coconut Chicken Strips on a bed of mixed kale greens. I came across a beautiful Mamey Sapote in the grocery store and added about Â½ cup of the fruit to each salad. A Mamey Sapote is a fruit native to Central America. I think it has a texture similar to a papaya but a flavor that reminds me of sweet potato.

[11] The mamey sapote grows into a handsome, open tree with a thick central trunk and a few large limbs. The fruit is a large, shaped like a football, varying in length from 6-9 inches depending of the cultivar. The skin is thick and woody with a russet brown scruffy surface. The pulp of a mature fruit is salmon pink to red, soft and smooth in texture. The flavor is a sweet, almond like, unique flavor. The fruit will weigh from 1 to 6 pounds. The mamey sapote is usually eaten fresh by hand or to make milkshakes or ice cream. It is also excellent for use in jellies, pastes and conserves.

[13] The fruit of the mamey is pink, and roughly oblong to circular in size. Large specimens can measure around 10 inches (25 centimeters) in length. The seed is toxic, and found in the center of the fruit; toxic extracts from the sapote seed are used in a variety of applications, including as an insecticide.

[14] Selecting fruit. There are two varieties of mamey sapote that most commonly grow in Florida. The larger, pointed, football-shaped Magana with its dark, salmon-colored flesh, and the smaller, round, Pantin, or Key West with its flesh colored a brighter salmon, and a bit sweeter flavor.

[16] December 18, 2016. This is an unofficial South Florida tropical fruit guide! Since some fruits ripen multiple times of the year, it is hard to be precise. You can always count on bananas every month of the year, but they do slow down a bit in the winter. We almost always have mamey sapote since the magana variety is ready very shortly after the Key West variety ends.

[18] Oaxacan cuisine is a regional cuisine of Mexico, centered on the city of Oaxaca, the capital of the state of the same name located in southern Mexico. It is made with fermented corn, cacao, and the seed of the mamey fruit. It is traditionally served in dried and painted gourds. Tejate is usually found in the towns just outside of the city of Oaxaca. It is similar to the pozol of Chiapas.

[19] Mammea americana L. The mamey stands almost midway between major and minor tropical fruits and is unique in remaining virtually static in the past 40 years, receiving little attention at home or abroad. Botanically, it is identified as Mammea americana L., of the family Guttiferae, and therefore related to the mangosteen, q.v.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly address the query "how often to button quail lay eggs." Based on the query, the following passages are relevant:

[1] Quails nest on the ground and lay six to twelve eggs. They sit on them for thirteen days and if the amount of eggs is too large for the hen, the cock will join her on the nest. Chicks are tiny, but are able to feed themselves straight away. If you wish to breed quails, provide a secluded area for them.

[3] Once the male and female quail start to mate then you will get fertile eggs. An indication that male quail are fertile is the foamball they have on their droppings. Eggs are usually fertile from about week 7/8 a week or two after the females start laying as long as they have had males in with them.

[8] DESCRIPTION: Japanese quail can be sexed as early as three weeks of age, based on the feather color which is distinct for the male and female of the species. When matured, the Japanese males weigh in the range of 100-140 grams (4-5 oz.), and they reach sexual maturity at 5 to 6 weeks of age. In this area, the feathers of the female quail are longer and more pointed than those of the male birds. The female Japanese may start laying eggs as early as 35 days of age under proper conditions, laying approximately 200-300 eggs a year.

[9] The quail begin to breed and lay eggs at only six to eight weeks of age, as opposed to the 20 to 24 weeks required for a chicken to begin producing. You should, of course, use only the biggest and best looking birds for breeding.

[13] Japanese quail will likely mature at around 7 to 8 weeks of age when body weight reaches 150 to 160 grams. A quail breeder diet should be introduced to birds at least 2 weeks before egg production is expected, or at the sight of the first egg. During a 15-week laying cycle, a breeder will produce approximately 80 eggs with a hatch rate of 80 percent.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance to the query.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly address the frequency of button quail laying eggs. Based on that, we can proceed with the ranking. 

Passages that directly address the frequency of button quail laying eggs:
[3] Really productive strains of Japanese or Coturnix quail as they are sometimes called can lay up to 300 eggs in a year, but for this level of egg production they do require the correct quail feed as well as some additional light over the dark winter months.
[4] They are also fast growing; it takes about 8 weeks for them to reach 12 ounces in optimal conditions. The Texas A & M Quail hens start laying eggs earlier than most other quail, and the eggs are of high quality and are in high demand.
[5] Japanese quail are hardy birds that thrive in small cages and are inexpensive to keep. They are affected by common poultry diseases but are fairly disease resistant. Japanese quail mature in about 6 weeks and are usually in full egg production by 50 days of age.
[10] Coturnix quail do not go broody so you will need to offer the necessary conditions to hatch the eggs. A hen will begin laying eggs between 6 to 8 weeks of age. They lay approximately an egg a day, depending on external conditions and the lines themselves. The total incubation time for the eggs is 17 days.
[14] DESCRIPTION: Japanese quail can be sexed as early as three weeks of age, based on the feather color which is distinct for the male and female of the species. When matured, the Japanese males weigh in the range of 100-140 grams (4-5 oz.), and they reach sexual maturity at 5 to 6 weeks of age. The female Japanese may start laying eggs as early as 35 days of age under proper conditions, laying approximately 200-300 eggs a year.

[1] They are affected by common poultry diseases but are fairly disease resistant. Japanese quail mature in about 6 weeks and are usually in full egg production by 50 days of age. With proper care, hens should lay 200 eggs in their first year of lay. Life expectancy is only 2 to 2½ years.
[4] You only need to eat two quail eggs per day to reach fifty percent of the recommended dose of vitamin D. Quails start egg laying at six weeks old and are into full egg production at fifty weeks of age. Expect two hundred to two hundred and fifty delicious eggs per year.
[8] Keep the breeders under 16 hours of light daily, and they will begin to lay eggs. Maintaining the same number of hours under lights will keep your Cortunix quail laying eggs throughout the year. Under prime conditions, each female bird will lay about 300 eggs each year.
[11] Coturnix quail do not go broody so you will need to offer the necessary conditions to hatch the eggs. A hen will begin laying eggs between 6 to 8 weeks of age. They lay approximately an egg a day, depending on external conditions and the lines themselves. The total incubation time for the eggs is 17 days.

[4] Quail start to lay eggs at just 8-12 weeks (assuming there is enough daylight) so they are productive very quickly compared to chickens. Four quail eggs are roughly the same as a chicken egg, although they have a slightly higher quantity of yolk to white in an egg.

[8] Like chickens, button quail can lay one egg a day every day, for almost her entire life. Without special attention, this practice can very quickly deplete the female of her bone calcium and other essential nutrients, leading to a very early death.

[19] Coturnix quail do not go broody so you will need to offer the necessary conditions to hatch the eggs. A hen will begin laying eggs between 6 to 8 weeks of age.

[1] So if you are raising the Button Quail in your home, they are going to receive this right combination all year round. If not addressed your females will then lay eggs all year. Laying eggs does take a lot out of them. So my advice would be to give your birds at least a 3 month break per year. If you're purchasing these quail as pets only and don't want any eggs, follow this procedure also.

[4] 1 Always collect eggs at least once a day to prevent the quail sitting on the egg (both female and male will sit on the egg). 2 Realise that a quail only lays one egg a day. If your quails are still not laying eggs, this may indicate that they are sick.

[5] A quail which is breed to lay eggs should receive 14 hours of light per day. This may mean that artificial lightning may be needed. If the quail receives the right amount of light, they will approx. lay 1 egg per day. On average they will lay 200-300 eggs per year. I hope this answered your question. How many eggs do quail lay at one time? No bird can lay more than an egg every day (or just a little less than 24 hours).

[10] Quails mature at 6 to 8 weeks and should be laying eggs by then. Stress due to overcrowding, move in location, predators, etc., will reduce your quail's egg production. When your quail does begin to lay eggs, start supplementing oyster shells for calcium.

[11] 1 An adult quail weights between 150 to 200 grams and an egg weights around 7 to 15 grams. 2 Female quails start laying eggs within their 6 to 7 weeks of age and continuously lay one egg daily. 3 They lay about 300 eggs in their first year of life.

[13] They are capable of laying around 230 eggs (some have laid up to 300) if kept in the right conditions, given some light during the shorter days and adequate protection from the cold over the winter.

[3] Others are button quail african quail and bobwhite quail which are also good layers..they lays btn one and two eggs a day. On average each quail can lay 300 eggs per year meaning each quail wouldn't lay egg on each day. However, wild quails of which some farmers are supplied by comen will rarely lay eggs.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the query "ia suffix meaning." Based on the query, the following passages seem to be the most relevant:

[11] -ia. suffix forming nouns. 1. occurring in place names: Albania; Columbia. 2. (Pathology) occurring in names of diseases and pathological disorders: pneumonia; aphasia. 3. occurring in words denoting condition or quality: utopia. 4. (Botany) occurring in names of botanical genera: acacia; poinsettia.

[16] What is the meaning of words that end with the suffix -tion? How did tion as a suffix started being pronounced as shun? What does the suffix "ology" mean?

[13] a noun suffix having restricted application in various fields, as in names of diseases (malaria; anemia), place names (Italia; Romania), names of Roman feasts (Lupercalia), Latin or Latinizing plurals (Amphibia; insignia; Reptilia), and in other loanwords from Latin (militia).

Passage [9] directly defines "geon" in the context of physics, while passages [1], [3], [4], and [5] mention different aspects or interpretations of the term "geon."

Now, let's move on to the passages that provide additional information related to the concept of geons:

[Start]
[11] > [12] > [6] > [7] [End]

Passages [11] and [12] discuss the concept of breaking down images into simple geometric shapes called geons, while passage [6] provides information about the characteristics of geons. Passage [7] mentions the origin and usage of the term "geon" in Korean.

Next, let's rank the passages that mention "geon" in unrelated contexts:

[Start]
[8] > [10] > [2] [End]

Passages [8], [10], and [2] refer to a video game called "Geon" developed by Strawdog Studios.

Finally, let's rank the remaining passages that are not directly related to the concept of "geon":

[Start]
[14] > [17] > [18] > [20] > [19] > [13] > [16] [End]

Passages [14], [17], [18], [20], [19], [13], and [16] discuss various unrelated topics such as shapes, SQL commands, surgery, and definitions of other terms.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the query "what is chaff and flare." Based on the query, the following passages seem to be the most relevant:

[5] The origin of the term chad is uncertain. Patent documents from the 1930s and 1940s show the word chad, often in reference to punched tape used in telegraphy. These patents sometimes include synonyms such as chaff and chips.

[4] What are the benefits of incinerators over flare systems? A flare stackâs combustion efficiency is dependent upon external environmental influences, while an incinerator maintains 99.9% combustion efficiency at all times.

[15] A flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots. Their frequency varies from several a day, when the sun is particularly active, to less than one a week during quiet periods. Large flares are less frequent than smaller ones. Solar activity varies within an 11-year cycle at the peak of which there are typically more sunspots and therefore more solar flares. What affect can they have on earth? X-rays and UV radiation emitted by solar flares can cause long-lasting radiation storms the Earthâs ionosphere â the uppermost part of the planetâs atmosphere â and trigger radio black-outs around the world.

Now, let's rank these passages in descending order of relevance.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the query "what is chaff and flare." Based on the query, passages that directly provide definitions or explanations of chaff and flare would be the most relevant. Let's rank those passages first. 

[Start] [4] > [8] > [12] > [15] [End]

Passage [4] provides a definition of chaff, while passage [8] explains the use of narrow band filters to observe flares. Passage [12] further discusses the translation of the word "chaff" in the Old Testament, and passage [15] provides a definition of a solar flare. These passages directly address the query and are therefore ranked as the most relevant.

Next, let's rank the passages that provide information related to flares, but may not directly address the query.

[Start] [6] > [14] > [19] > [5] > [7] [End]

Passage [6] discusses the causes of solar flares, while passage [14] explains the impact of solar flares on human activities. Passage [19] provides information about flaring in oil/gas operations, and passage [5] mentions flares in the context of arthritis. Passage [7] discusses the lens flare effect in Photoshop. Although these passages are not directly about chaff and flare, they provide relevant information related to flares.

Now, let's rank the remaining passages that mention chaff or flare but may not provide detailed explanations.

[Start] [2] > [13] > [11] > [20] > [10] > [9] > [3] [End]

Passage [2] mentions chaff in the context of hide grooming, while passage [13] explains the process of flaring in plumbing. Passage [11] discusses threshing and the separation of chaff from grain. Passage [20] mentions flare-ups in the context of eczema. Passages [10], [9], and [3] briefly mention flares or flare-ups but do not provide extensive information.

This completes the ranking of the passages based on their relevance to the query "what is chaff and flare."

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the query "what is chaff and flare." Based on the query, the following passages seem to be the most relevant:

[1] Definition of chaff. 1 : the seed coverings and other debris separated from the seed in threshing grain. 2 : something comparatively worthless a few kernels of wisdom amid much discursive chaff â Steven Raichlen.
[12] Definition of chaff. 1 1 : the seed coverings and other debris separated from the seed in threshing grain. 2 2 : something comparatively worthless a few kernels of wisdom amid much discursive chaff â Steven Raichlen.
[11] What is a Hyder flare? Flares are intense brightenings that occur in the solar chromosphere. Flares are generally observed from Earth using narrow band filters, typically with a bandwidth of less than 0.1 nm, and often centred on the Hydrogen-alpha wavelength of 656.3 nm.
[13] What is a solar flare? A solar flare is a large explosion of magnetic energy in the Sunâs atmosphere which causes an intense burst of increased brightness. They cannot be detected by the naked eye from the surface of the earth but can be observed through telescopes, space x-rays and thermal imaging equipment.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that are most relevant to the query "is caffeine an narcotic." 

Based on the query, the following passages are most relevant:
[3] Cocaine and meth are not narcotics. They are stimulants, the exact opposite of a narcotic. They cause people to be more awake and more active, not sleepy. Calling them narcotics makes as much sense as calling coffee a narcotic.
[18] The word narcotic comes from the Greek word narkos, meaning sleep. Therefore, narcotics are drugs that induce sleep. Specifically, that means the opiates such as heroin, morphine and related drugs. This is the correct meaning, so you should accept no other. Cocaine and meth are not narcotics. They are stimulants, the exact opposite of a narcotic.

Now, let's rank the passages in descending order of relevance to the query:

[Start]
[3] > [18]
[End]

Please note that the ranking is based on the relevance of the passages to the query and does not imply the accuracy of the statements made in the passages.

[11] No, opiates and opioids are derived from poppies, and are narcotic pain relievers and exist in a class of depressants. Caffeine, on the other hand, is found in many plants, e.g., coffee, guarana, different types of tea, etc. It is a natural stimulant and does not, in fact, relieve pain.

[12] No, opiates and opioids are derived from poppies, and are narcotic pain relievers and exist in a class of depressants. Caffeine, on the other hand, is found in many plants, e.g., coffee, guarana, different types of tea, etc. It is a natural stimulant and does not, in fact, relieve pain. So, in effect, it is fairly opposite to opiates.

Now, let's rank these two passages:

[Start] [11] > [12] [End]

Please note that the ranking is based on the relevance of the passages to the query, with [11] being the most relevant and [12] being the second most relevant.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly address how granulation tissue starts. Based on that, we can proceed with the ranking. Here are the passages that directly address the query:

[1] 1 Over the next 3 weeks or so, the body repairs broken blood vessels and new tissue grows. 2 Red blood cells help create collagen, which are tough, white fibers that form the foundation for new tissue. 3 The wound starts to fill in with new tissue, called granulation tissue. New skin begins to form over this tissue.
[3] Tissue granulation is a process by which fibrous tissue rich with blood capillaries replaces blood clots formed at the site of a healing wound. Through this process, healthy and normal skin is able to replace skin that was damaged. The tissue that forms over a wound during this process is called granulation tissue.
[8] Fibroblasts is the main modifier of granulation tissue and at the start comprises of type III collagen network which is mostly weak. This network is then replaced by much stronger type of Collagen I stranded network. This is the collagen which we see in the form of scar tissue.
[11] Granulation tissue is new connective tissue and microscopic blood vessels that form on the surfaces of a wound during the healing process. Granulation tissue typically grows from the base of a wound and is able to fill wounds of almost any size.
[12] Granulation tissue is new connective tissue and tiny blood vessels that form on the surfaces of a wound during the healing process. Granulation tissue typically grows from the base of a wound and is able to fill wounds of almost any size.
[13] Tissue granulation is a process by which fibrous tissue rich with blood capillaries replaces blood clots formed at the site of a healing wound. Through this process, healthy and normal skin is able to replace skin that was damaged. The tissue that forms over a wound during this process is called granulation tissue.
[18] Granulation tissue itself is composed largely of newly growing capillaries (angiogenesis) and is so called because the irregular surface is created by the capillaries looping together on the wound surface, giving the appearance of red lumps (or granules) throughout paler pink normal matrix.

Now, let's proceed with the ranking:

[Start] [1] > [3] > [8] > [11] > [12] > [13] > [18] [End]

Please note that this ranking is based on the passages that directly address how granulation tissue starts.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly address the query "why did the ancient Egyptians call their land kemet, or black land?". Based on the query, the most relevant passages would be those that provide an explanation or insight into the reason behind this naming. Let's begin the ranking process:

[Start] [2] > [5] > [8] > [11] > [19] [End]

Explanation:
- Passage [2] directly explains that the ancient Egyptians called their land Kemet or Black Land because of the black sediments carried by the Nile River during floods.
- Passage [5] provides additional information about the term Kemet and its association with the rich soil found in the Nile Valley and Delta.
- Passage [8] expands on the symbolism of the Ankh, including its association with the black land and the Nile.
- Passage [11] mentions the term Kemet and its meaning as the Black Land, providing historical context.
- Passage [19] mentions the ancient Egyptians calling the black soil from the floods the "Gift of the Nile," which is related to the naming of the land as Kemet.

Please note that this is an initial ranking based on the relevance to the query. Further adjustments can be made if needed.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly address the difference between a company's strategy and business model. Based on a quick analysis, the following passages seem to be most relevant to the query:

[1] Business architecture is the bridge between the enterprise business model and the enterprise strategy on one side, and the business functionality of the corporate business or organization on the other side.
[4] Business architecture is the bridge between the enterprise business model and enterprise strategy on one side, and the business functionality of the enterprise on the other side.
[8] Definition of business model. This describes the method or means by which a company tries to capture value from its business. A business model may be based on many different aspects of a company, such as how it makes, distributes, prices or advertises its products. The business model concentrates on value creation.
[10] As described, a business model is more generic than a business strategy. Coupling strategy analysis with business model analysis is necessary in order to protect whatever competitive advantage results from the design and implementation of new business models.
[11] In any case, both the business model and the business strategy describe how the company succeeds: How it creates customer value, how it competes with others in the same industry, and how it generates revenues and spends to create good margins.
[14] Business Plan. In many cases, the business plan is the home of the business model and the business strategy. The business plan explains every aspect of the business, including the model and strategy, while identifying the affiliated staff, equipment, and finances needed to achieve profit.
[15] In the broadest sense, "strategy" is a plan for how to achieve a goal. In business, strategy bridges the gap between policy (guidelines governing action) and tactics (a set of techniques). Strategy is what a company develops to differentiate itself from competitors' actual or predicted moves. It's complex and it drives every decision a business makes.
[16] The Difference Between Corporate Strategy & Business Strategy. A small business operating in a single industry must develop and exploit a competitive advantage if it is to be profitable. You can gain a competitive advantage by outperforming your competition in some aspect of business to produce your goods or services at a lower cost.
[20] Read this article to learn about the differences between "Business Markets" and "Consumer Markets" – Explained! There are significant differences between consumer and business markets. It is important to understand and appreciate the difference to be able to design appropriate strategies for the business markets.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly answer the query "what medium do radio waves travel through." Based on that, we can proceed with the ranking. 

Passages that directly answer the query:
[2] Waves, Sound and Light. A mechanical wave is created when a source of energy causes a vibration to travel through a medium. A mechanical wave is a disturbance in matter that carries energy from one place to another. The material through which a wave travels is called a medium. Mechanical waves require a medium to travel through.
[5] These waves travel when molecules in the medium collide with each other passing on energy. One example of a mechanical wave is sound. Sound can travel through air, water, or solids, but it can't travel through a vacuum. It needs the medium to help it travel.
[10] For three of the four, you have named the medium ... rope, slinky, and. tuning fork. In each case, there would be no wave without it. The radio wave, as well as all other electromagnetic waves, can travel. through material media, but don't need one in order to propagate.
[11] Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate. This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space.
[13] RF propagation occurs at the speed of light and does not need a medium like air in order to travel.
[14] An electromagnetic wave (this includes light) does not require a physical medium - it can travel through empty space.

Now, let's rank the passages based on their relevance to the query:

[Start] [2] > [5] > [10] > [11] > [13] > [14] [End]

Please note that this is an initial ranking based on the direct relevance to the query. We can further refine the ranking if needed.

 original response: Sure! Let's start by identifying the passages that directly answer the query "what medium do radio waves travel through." Based on that, we can proceed with the ranking. 

The passages that directly answer the query are:
[1] Microwaves are electromagnetic rays with a frequency range of 0.3 GHz to 300 Ghz. They are found between the radio waves and the infrared waves in the electromagnetic spectrum. Microwave radiation is the radiating wave movement in which microwave energy travels. This type of energy takes a straight line path. Like all electromagnetic waves, they do not require a medium to travel through. They can pass through non-metal materials like plastic and glass, but get reflected off metal surfaces.

[4] Electromagnetic waves are waves that can travel through a vacuum (empty space). They don't need a medium or matter. They travel through electrical and magnetic fields that are generated by charged particles. Examples of electromagnetic waves include light, microwaves, radio waves, and X-rays.

Now, let's rank the passages based on their relevance to the query:

[Start] [4] > [1] [End]

 original response: Sure! Let's start by eliminating any passages that are not directly related to the difference between a hotel and motel. We can focus on passages that provide information or comparisons specifically about hotels and motels. Here are the relevant passages:

[3] Difference Between Hotel and motel. 1 Food and beverage service. 2 Room attendant ( Housekeeping ) service. 3 Concierge. 4 Laundry or dry cleaning service. 5 Use of furniture or fixtures. 6 Bell and Door attendant service. 7 Conference and Banqueting. 8 Business center, etc.

[11] In 1925, Los Angeles architect Arthur Heineman built the first motel in San Luis Obispo, halfway between San Francisco and L.A. He coined the term motel, meaning motor hotel, and named this first property Milestone. For $1.25 a night, guests were issued a two-room bungalow with a kitchen and a private adjoining garage.

Now, let's rank these two passages based on their relevance to the query.
